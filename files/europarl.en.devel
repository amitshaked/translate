These findings form the basis of the European programmes to protect the Barents Sea, and that is why I would ask you to examine a draft letter setting out the most important facts and to make Parliament's position, as expressed in the resolutions which it has adopted, clear as far as Russia is concerned.
We shall therefore look into it properly to ensure that everything is as it should be.
I was told that large sections of the Socialist Group were also keen to have this item taken off the agenda, because at the vote in the Conference of Presidents no vote was received from the working group of Members of the Socialist Group responsible for this matter.
I therefore repeat the proposal that this oral question to the Commission and the Council should be retained so that we can find out, once and for all, the positions of these two bodies regarding the proposal which is relatively modest but which would give a clear message to public opinion, particularly after the tide of feeling generated by the failure of the Seattle Conference.
The relevant standards which have been laid down in another Directive, 95/35/EC, seem sufficiently adequate to advise people in a responsible manner on the organisation of the transport of dangerous goods.
In principle, I believe that in many cases where transport is concerned we should be working towards increased flexibility and country-specific rules.
A further amendment allows the Member States to impose more stringent requirements, in particular for vacuum tanks, if work is done or goods are transported as a priority in temperatures well below -20ºC.
It is nonetheless worth emphasising that, each time we make this type of decision, it is good from a broad environmental perspective and it is beneficial because it creates better prior conditions for exploiting the possibilities of the internal market.
This is extraordinarily positive, and there is cause to thank the rapporteur, Mr Koch, for the work he has put in on this issue.
I would like to ask the Vice-President if she is in a position to tell us today what the state of play is with regard to the efforts towards harmonisation being made by these two organisations, and whether the EU is in a position to hasten these harmonisation efforts, in accordance with principles that are as simple as possible.
We feel that it is important that the Commission takes account of the conclusions adopted by this Parliament, at least in spirit, because at this stage, it might seem as though what we are doing here is a useless exercise, and nothing but hot air.
Small and medium-sized businesses, above all, need to take part in the distribution of these funds.
This is not the first time that this issue has not been given the consideration it deserves. This has been an ongoing concern for the five years that I have been a Member of this Parliament, and I have raised the issue time and time again.
Little consideration, if any at all, has been given to the great problems facing the island regions of the Union whose shortcomings as regards infrastrucutres structure, transport, communication and energy has resulted in their gradual depopulation.
Even if the Commission is still reluctant to say so in too explicit a fashion, its periodic report demonstrates the urgent need to promote polycentric development of the Community area through the Union' s structural policies and within the scope of the approach initiated by the SEC.
This, Commissioner, is the first commandment for the coming period.
As indicated by the rapporteur, the effects of the structural measures, on the other hand, are minimal as far as employment is concerned.
On this point which is of personal interest to me, let me remind you that the small scale of this sector - and this does not necessarily mean that it is an insignificant area - and its concentration in a limited number of regions do not make it easy to analyse in a regional context.
The Commission is the executive and Parliament ought to have no desire whatsoever to take on this role, for the sake of its own independence; but Parliament is a supervisory body, and what better forum could there be in which to expound the reasoning behind one' s decisions than a democratically-elected Parliament, indeed an ongoing parliamentary discussion?
As you know, Commissioner, our report argues that the codecision procedure should apply in the case of basic legislation on state aid.
He mentioned earlier that the report was carried with a significant majority but not with my support.
I mentioned this again to Commissioner Monti recently.
I find it difficult to understand how he can index regional and social funds into this mathematical equation.
Forms of state aid that require an effort from the beneficiary are to be supported.
A point to consider regarding the new rules concerns the economy of the outermost regions and islands, all of which must be protected.
But here I would like to call on my experience as a lawyer.
Most SMEs have in fact less than 30% of the market share.
For it to enter into force, it must be ratified by all 15 Member States.
After five years only four have done so.
There is no intention whatsoever to create a transnational criminal law and judicial authority, rather the aim is to equip the Union with specific instruments for the protection of its financial interests, that is whilst upholding the principle of subsidiarity.
The compatibility with the various national systems of law, as confirmed by experts, shows that criminal law is another area where Europe has a great deal in common, for example where the significance of the offences we have been discussing here is concerned.
We should alter the staff regulations and disciplinary procedures and, especially, change our practice.
Indeed when the plan was initially drawn up they said it would be restricted to cases of fraud against the EU budget.
Today, something has changed, at least in terms of mechanisms, and especially as regards monitoring, but we are still not satisfied, particularly if debates are held in competent fora that go as far as to discuss a European Public Prosecutor, crimes, fraud, the misappropriation of funds and the disclosure of confidential information pertaining to one' s office at European level.
On behalf of the Commission I am able to congratulate the rapporteur on having again addressed the genuinely difficult question as to what we can do, in terms of creating legal bases and effecting institutional change, to step up the fight against fraud perpetrated against the European Union.
(The President declared the common position approved (as amended))
Report (A5-0107/1999) by Mr Berend, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Sixth Periodic Report on the Social and Economic Situation and Development of the Regions of the European Union (SEC(1999)0066 - C5-0120/1999 - 1999/2123(COS))
In line with the usual procedure, it is the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) which puts forward standards in this area, and they are then integrated in to the European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road signed in Geneva in 1957 (known generally as ADR), applicable throughout Europe, whose terms and conditions form the basis for the legislation applicable within the EU.
In general, the current guidelines cannot be considered as clear or transparent.
.
Expenditure becomes an end in itself, evidence of the success of a programme.
The statistics published by the European Commission in its sixth report do however show, as Mr Berend pointed out, the limitations of the policy being implemented:
The poorest regions are gradually making good their underdevelopment.
Indeed, the White Paper envisages that the Commission will retain the supervision and central direction of the new system.
It is a quite different Europe which is taking shape in the long term.
Just as the Court of Justice recognised in its order of 3 May 1996, the iron and steel industry is particularly sensitive to disturbances to its competitive operation.
The Commission suggests that Member States submit their reports within a time limit of two months following the end of each six-month period or, at least, annually, without the need for reminders.
Finally, we have the problem of the consequences of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty.
My feeling in this respect is that only a Council Regulation can provide the necessary legal certainty and ensure an official ban on any aid not covered by the code.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.05 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
What guarantees are there of its reliability?
Surely it is now about time that not only the Member States but that toothless tiger that is known as the International Maritime Organisation, and last but not least, the oil companies and tanker owners take on their responsibilities by acting to stop these ecological and human tragedies repeating themselves year after year.
How many more seabirds are to die before shipping companies end the practice of cleaning their tanks at sea which, as our resolution points out, causes far more pollution than any Erika-type disaster?
Some say that it is the worst accident that has ever befallen the bird life of this part of Europe.
When will we see a return to cleanliness and the end of this devastating accident?"
And, on this subject, Commissioner, you did not mention how the Commission intends to contribute to the restoration of the natural environment and the natural habitats.
This is no longer tolerable.
Let us ensure, Mr President, Commissioner, that this time we really do learn the lesson, even after the media hype and the shock of this House have died down.
We must regulate the use of flags of convenience, make double hulls mandatory for the transport of polluting or dangerous materials, work on technological innovations in order to be able to process or recover hydrocarbons at sea.
Mr President, I would welcome some action in this area.
I will tell you a few things we should do.
Last but not least, we need a long memory, for the issue of legislation will crop up on the agenda more frequently in the near future.
I do not think that we can accept their procedures.
How is it possible not to be outraged when a bank refuses to divulge the names of the Erika' s owners on the grounds of professional confidentiality, without governments reacting?
So we are now experiencing the same thing that happened 20 years ago with the Amoco Cadiz; a wreck on the North coast, a wreck on the South coast, a wreck on the West coast.
Commissioner, I would also like to thank you for the speedy response of your department to this event and the measures which are being adopted and implemented.
Any cost-benefit analysis which truly takes into account all the harm occasioned to persons and the environment by these accidents, is bound to support this approach.
In Europe, legislation is stricter and it is compulsory to inspect 25% of the incoming vessels according to the port-state control directive.
Would it not be beneficial, in the short term, following the Rotterdam model, to inspect according to a points system in which, for example, account is taken of the ship' s age, whether it is single or double-hulled or whether it sails under a flag of convenience.
Construction of this type of ship was halted at the time because the risk of rusting was especially high.
RINA is currently the talk of the town.
Ultimately, the polluter must pay.
In addition we must build on the Council directive dealing with enforcement of international standards for ship safety and pollution prevention by ensuring that the inspection goal of 25% of ships calling at EU ports is met and that a high standard of inspection is delivered.
As for the inspections, very much a key question, the first thing we have to consider is how the current legislation has worked, as Mr Hatzidakis has said.
We will have the opportunity to do so on other occasions.
The thinning-out we need is not being attended to; the forests are not being tended to the requisite degree.
This is wrong! And no one can comprehend this attitude.
I urge the Commission not to keep having to be asked and to provide assistance for the victims of the storms.
We must reduce CO2 emissions, employ renewable energies, and generally make enquiries, in this connection, as to how the forests of Europe are faring.
I hope that we can thrash this out.
The rapid alert system for feed is something that we have identified as a gap in the legislation.
I am happy that he raised it because it is particularly important for this authority to have a high profile.
We must attempt to avoid that and establish the structures so as to ensure that there is a proper dissemination of information between scientists, that there is full consultation and discussion and that the authority at Community level has the opportunity and is mandated to seek the advice and opinion of independent scientists in all Member States and indeed maybe even beyond, where experts are to be found elsewhere.
Mrs Myller then asked me about the location of the Authority.
The fact is that the agenda said that we would begin at 5.30 p.m., and you can see the clock.
In this sense, there is therefore a serious risk that some idiot will decide that the new geopolitical balance of power in the Caucasus calls for a nearby country with weapons grade nuclear technology.
If the conclusion is that Turkey is planning to build a nuclear power plant that does not meet normal European safety standards is concerned then we would do the same as we did with Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria.
The Balkan Task Force was hampered by the fact that little or no information was available on the actual use of these weapons during the conflict.
From a desk assessment coupled with a fact-finding mission the report concludes that the risks, if any, are limited to an area around the target.
If the latter do not have the required professional competence, then nothing will happen and gender mainstreaming will no longer be a priority.
Question No 38 by (H-0805/99):
Three serious issues were discussed: the first was the first discussion on the fifth programme for women, of which I gave an initial evaluation, the second issue was the report by Mr Busquin on the investigation into the participation of women in research and science, and the third involved Mr Kinnock, who reported to the working group on efforts being made to take account of the gender equality dimension in the overall reforms currently taking place in the Community.
The EQUAL initiative is not restricted to certain groups of people.
Subject: Article 13 TEU and Employment The draft Commission Directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation gives exemption to religious organisations (Art. 4.2).
A month ago, the Commission submitted a proposal on equal treatment in employment, as prescribed in the Treaty, in order to implement Article 13.
Subject: Compliance with Directive 96/71/EC concerning the posting of workers The posting of workers directive has still not been implemented in Denmark, even though the deadline has passed.
We are waiting to see what the next move will be.
This has now been done.
Mr President, the Committee on Industry decided to go ahead and draw up a report on the discharge for 1997 although we were not specifically asked to do so.
One is nuclear safety in Eastern Europe. We have to get this right.
I am sure you will be relieved to hear that as well.
We have still not had a response to crucial questions of this type.
At the moment, our group still feels sympathy for, and patience with, the Commission because it cannot be held responsible for a large proportion of the mistakes made in the past, but this patience has a limit.
In response to this the Commission has entered into various commitments and has certainly adopted many reform measures.
New rules have been drawn up and implemented governing the appointment of senior officials.
In order to achieve this, action is required in four areas.
They must be implemented without delay.
All the experts can provide information and news, formulate opinions and give advice, but, they have no political or elective responsibility, and rightly so.
Our position was made very clear on this topic in the 2000 budget.
I think that the report drawn up by the Wise Men has been useful and I think that it is also useful for this Parliament - as already stated by Mrs Morgan - that we ourselves should ask for expertise from outside for once to see how our administration is run.
In any case, it should be clear that my group, of course, fully backs the recommendations made by the Committee of Wise Men.
It would be marvellous if this report were to give the green light to result-oriented spending of this kind, with all the work organised on that basis.
Commissioners should not be considered senior officials but rather politicians in office.
Up until now, the Commission' s payments could only be made when the authorising officer signed the appropriate order and the financial controller gave his approval in the form of a visa.
They have a much wider responsibility.
What we need, then, are basic administrative regulations for the EU, for its institutions and for the EU in its relations with the Member States.
However, Mr Kinnock, your presentation to the Committee on Budgetary Control this coming Tuesday must not just be a one-way street; rather, as Parliamentarians, we want, and must, play a part in this and it also goes against my understanding of politics when I find that yet another press conference has taken place this week, before we have had chance to carefully discuss the submission in the competent Committee on Budgetary Control.
The great majority of the paper's proposals are closely akin to those put by Mr van Hulten and that paper includes - I say to him and to Mr Staes - a very explicit timetable of actions to be undertaken in pursuit of reform.
Before leaving this area I would add that we agree with the rapporteur that the existing internal audit function must be maintained pending the establishment of the new independent internal audit service in a matter of months.
The possibility of using specified external channels will also be addressed.
Members will recall that the European Union is the largest financial donor to the overall efforts in bringing reconciliation to the people of the Middle East.
I hope the House will understand that.
I consider this to be very encouraging news.
Fulfil your obligations to Parliament in a generous spirit, thus preparing for the future.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is rather moving for me to return to this House in my capacity as a Member of the Council.
We will accordingly give the Chairman of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs the provisional agendas for the Council meetings in March and May, to allow contact to be established beforehand on the subjects to be discussed in the Council. We will do this today.
With regard to the Judicial Network, significant progress has been made, in particular the launch at the end of 1999 of the dedicated telecommunications system of the European Judicial Network, whilst the Multi-disciplinary Group has developed a series of actions to implement the 1997 action plan.
There is therefore an urgent need to grant Parliament codecision rights in this respect and, as we have already said, to strengthen the principle of democratic control.
Mr Vitorino, whom I would like to thank for his speech, can give us that, provided that he has the necessary financial and human resources.
The Presidency and the Council can realise what was incomprehensibly rejected in Tampere, even though this summit provided an important basis.
Freedom, security and justice are the root system of any society, reflecting its history, corporate experience and political development.
They need a 'European soul' , as a distinguished Spanish professor once said.
We accept the predominant role of the Council in this, but there are reservations and I am sure that the Council will listen to the words coming from the elected parliamentarians here when they go through it in more detail.
Let us not pretend that national parliaments are able to exercise effective democratic control of government activities in this area.
Mr President, esteemed gentlemen from Portugal, especially the Council representatives, you face great expectations on our part.
Thank you, Minister.
This is, of course, a highly sensitive issue.
This question will naturally be one of our key concerns, and the European Commission will not fail to take this into account.
The European Parliament will have the opportunity to take part in the preparatory group for the next Intergovernmental Conference.
Have the Council of Fisheries Ministers and the Commission assessed the impact of transferring the Portuguese quota for ICES zones XI and X and CECAF zone 34.1.1 to France (5000 metric tonnes per year overfishing) on the ICES zone VIII anchovy stocks and their responsibility for the current situation of the anchovy stocks and the possible social and economic impact on this fisheries sector in the future?
As for the Southern stocks of anchovy in ICES zone IX, the TAC was fixed at 10 000 tonnes for the whole of 2000 as opposed to 13 000 tonnes in 1999.
In the light of the above, will the Council reconsider the funding for the reconstruction of Kosovo, as requested by Parliament?
What other practical measures will it take to put a stop to ethnic cleansing?
It is a structure to which the European Union has given as much support as it can and to which the countries of the European Union have contributed in various ways.
If so, does it intend to do so within a general redefinition of the region, avoiding as far as possible the multiplication of micro-States, as has tended to happen elsewhere, and reuniting the parties, in this case Kosovo and Albania?
These cultural dimensions, however, almost always have their own economic dimension in turn, that is the level of resources which can be called on specifically to provide aid for cultural initiatives.
The problem facing us at the moment is whether there is currently a consensus within the European Union on this issue being included, particularly bearing in mind that if one such issue is included, other issues of a similar nature will probably be added to the conference' s agenda.
In view of this situation, renewed interest has been expressed in the proposal by James Tobin, winner of the Nobel Prize for Economics, to create a tax on currency transactions. The rate of this would be very low so that it did not affect trade in goods or investments, but it would act as a light brake on the wheels of speculation, thereby checking the multiplication of short-term transactions.
One of the most common objections is that such a tax would be too complex, but this could be said of any tax. If this argument had been accepted in the past, then no taxes would ever have been created.
In addition, this sort of measure would also seriously hamper the development of the financial markets and would stand in the way of the principle of the free movement of capital, which is one of the central tenets of the internal market.
If the knowledge of the facts and this debate and the arguments are as we say, and I think that they are right, then to take up another six months of the Commission' s time and occasion uncertainty on the financial and capital markets would be irresponsible.
As for the argument that this initiative would increase uncertainty, very short-term capital movements are specifically intended to play on uncertainty and to bet on changes between currencies or various short-term financial assets.
What is necessary is to throw some sand into the wheels of the currency speculators, stockbrokers and option traders.
The Tobin tax will bring some transparency to a very obscure question.
No longer should there be a place in democracy for the worship of, or for this fatalist approach towards, market forces as adopted by the liberals - and I am sorry that Mr Gasòliba I Böhm has left - as this will only lead to its ruin.
So if we want to look into what causes exchange rate instability, then we need to take into account the elements of good governance and focus on these first.
Could you please draw his attention to the fact that I have something to say to him?
Following a request to this effect, which I have received from a number of political groups, and following the meeting of the Conference of Presidents which has just been held, I propose that we add to the agenda a one and a half hour debate on a topical and urgent subject of major importance, pursuant to Rule 50 of our Rules of Procedure, on the subject of the European Union' s reaction with regard to the talks in Austria on forming a government.
Madam President, it would really be very difficult to imagine a debate which is more in accordance with Rule 50 of our Rules of Procedure.
Words in politics can be incendiary, can be inflammatory, or can be conciliatory.
(Applause)
And, to paraphrase one of my renowned fellow Belgians, one of the founders of Europe, Paul-Henri Spaak, I shall say that it is not yet too late for you, but now is the time to change your mind.
Madam President, today we have an appointment with hypocrisy.
(Applause)
However, that is not the problem.
I would have liked to hear your discussion with the Austrian President, Mr Poettering. We are well aware that he is very embarrassed today at the dirty deal that government has done in forming such an alliance.
Its aim was to combat the forgetfulness and the evil in today' s society which takes the form of xenophobia and neo-nazism.
It is the meeting of Europe with itself, with its raison d' être, with the reasons why we are here in this Chamber.
I am duty- bound to say to this House, there is no ambiguity or fragility or complacency in the opinion offered, or indeed the action taken, by the Commission on this issue.
We made explicit reference yesterday morning in our statement, as did the President this afternoon, to the fact that we share the concern demonstrated by fourteen Member States in their statement on Monday.
There is no complacency, no fragility and no ambiguity about any of that at all.
That is why we sustain that conclusion as we continue to uphold the values and the law.
It also appears in a range of international texts, for example, the Rio Declaration and most recently the Bio-Safety Protocol.
The initial decision to apply the precautionary principle depends largely on the level of protection sought and the level of risk that decision-makers are prepared to accept for society.
All these elements have to apply cumulatively.
By setting out in some detail how the Commission applies, and intends to apply, the precautionary principle, we hope to be able to clarify the situation at Community level and to contribute to the ongoing debate at European and international level.
This issue is extremely topical.
Mr President, I believe that the precautionary principle needs to be quite radical in order to work, otherwise we shall always be confused by all the different interpretations possible.
The debate is closed.
In light of what I have said, I ask Parliament to approve the opinion which Mr Leinen and I have put before you, so that on 14 February, the work of the Intergovernmental Conference can begin and our two representatives, Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos, can proceed with the difficult task that awaits them with the European Parliament' s backing.
Mr President, the Group of the European People' s Party was not satisfied with the conclusions of the European Council in Helsinki.
We should no longer be worried that the agenda for the IGC will be restricted.
This is something I would stress, particularly with my being an MEP for one of the major Member States.
The Europe which results from this is not stronger but weaker, as it no longer knows what it is or what it is defending.
Mr President, the President of the Commission was not being quite honest when he talked last week about the Intergovernmental Conference.
This is particularly important where enlargement is concerned, and legislation and in relation to treaties, which entail changes being made to legislation.
The overall plan failed to do justice to any of this.
If we succeed in making progress here, then we will also be ready for the historic task of enlarging the European Union.
The aim was not to draw conclusions - it was impossible to draw any - but the debate was certainly very encouraging.
If there is a democratic deficit at the end of this IGC, then I say that the political groups which so wanted this haste will be accountable for this.
However, that is precisely what is happening.
In other words, if we are not represented fully in the Commission we will not have an input into policy discussions.
The question is if we will undertake enlargement whether we are prepared or not.
The functionalist approach has brought us to this point.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the report which they produced after extremely thorough and meticulous work, your two rapporteurs, Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen, proposed that Parliament should adopt a formal opinion pursuant to Article 48 of the Treaty and thus, if this opinion were adopted, the Intergovernmental Conference could effectively start on 14 February, as suggested by the Portuguese Presidency.
Firstly there is the question as to what this directive is actually designed to achieve, that is achieve in the real sense.
For that reason, we shall vote against both these proposals.
Mr President, Commissioner, first and foremost I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur and to Mr Wieland for the efforts they have expended in summing up the various proposed amendments and interests in this report in such a balanced manner.
These two proposals contribute considerably to the implementation of one of the four key principles of the internal market for the freedom to provide services.
The aim of the two present proposals for a directive is to promote the free movement of services within the internal market by means of introducing the EU service provision card.
Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on a report, which, on reading it, gives the impression of simply confirming and accepting the Council' s draft decision.
However I also believe that the reforms must go further than those we are to adopt here.
However, as Mr Marinho has pointed out, more is necessary, but that has to wait for the IGC,
As your Parliament is aware, the Commission is convinced that, without fundamental reform, the Community judicial bodies run the risk - in the short term - of no longer being able to carry out their task within reasonable deadlines.
Accordingly, we would like to take this opportunity to urge the Commission and Council Presidency to seize this political initiative, so as to avoid us landing in such a desperate situation again and having to restore our solvency at the end of a month.
Only, now we want to see this translate into deeds and we also want to see success in Kosovo, and I would urge the Commission to see that these funds are put to good use, notably for building up the police force and for establishing the judiciary.
Commissioner, an agreement is an agreement.
In the first place, this new five-year programme will entail extending the actions in the ALTENER I programme. This will include extending the exchange of information and expertise between operators in the renewable energy sources sector, developing local and regional energy agencies, and establishing new networks for approving financial support, to name but a few examples.
In the event we had to have several meetings before the Council finally increased this to a substantial amount.
I would like once again to thank all who helped in this conciliation process.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would once again like to thank Mrs Ahern for her work as rapporteur on this proposal, since she has contributed, in collaboration with the other Members, to the achievement of a very reasonable final result, which in some respects even improves on the proposals of the Commission itself and, of course, on what, from a budgetary point of view, the Council had initially accepted.
We have to hope that at the forthcoming IGC we will also end up with qualified majority decisions in the area of culture.
They all made a vital constructive and balanced contribution.
Madam President, I reiterate my thanks to Parliament for its support and for, once again, having shown the importance it attaches to culture in the context of the Union.
We should not overlook the fact that, although quotas are an important point in recycling and recovery, they are by no means the only point.
Let us have the courage to put together a ground-breaking directive.
If car manufacturers need to bear the cost of recycling their cars, they will design these cars in such a way that they can be re-used more easily and more cheaply.
I commend Mr Florenz, Mr Lange and others who have sought from both sides of the party divide a compromise based on shared costs.
The other question is who should bear the cost.
We should also aim for minimum quantities of heavy metals, as well as of other dangerous substances and materials.
If the system of delivering cars to treatment facilities without any cost is applied, it will also transpire that the cost of processing will come down considerably.
If you charge this from day one, you can process the old cars straight away.
If we do reduce it, we remove from manufacturers the incentive to design and produce cars which give rise to less waste.
If these amendments are adopted, I think that we shall cause Parliament seriously to lose credibility on environmental issues.
Mr President, this excellent directive will end the dumping of old cars, encourage recycling, and above all encourage manufacturers to design cars which can easily be recycled.
In contrast to what the previous speaker said, I can say I am really proud that a common position was achieved during the Finnish Presidency to uphold environmental values.
It is far too prescriptive.
The plastics industry for the most part does not want to take these things back and cannot economically do so.
We can no longer take care of these matters at the end of a product' s life-cycle. Instead, we should avoid creating so much waste.
We must create forms of motive power which are not damaging to health and which are of such a kind that we can deal with the relevant waste, recycle materials and compete by means of environmentally friendly and fuel-efficient cars.
As I have said, we have both the knowledge and the resources to cope with these issues.
Thank you, Mr van Velzen.
People must realise this!
Basically, these proposals introduce the EU service provision card which will in future enable almost 5 million third country nationals legally resident in a European Union Member State to provide services in other Member States, a phenomenon currently obstructed by problems such as the need to obtain visas and work permits.
It is crucial for us that it should be possible for this Intergovernmental Conference to be concluded before the end of the year 2000 so that there are no remaining formalities, such as the weighting of votes in the Council of Ministers and the composition of the Commission and the European Parliament, which place obstacles in the way of the enlargement of the EU.
But, going beyond this petty political operation, what the majority in the European Parliament is afraid of most of all is that the threat to the left-right cohabitation in Austria, which caused political life to stagnate and rot, may soon spread to the European system of co-management which is producing equally appalling results.
Or their Socialist back-up troops who, in this House, have the cheek to thrust their values down our throats?
I disagree, however, for this very reason, with the senseless actions taken by the Presidency - the Portuguese Presidency unfortunately - which have resulted in a real institutional blunder on behalf of the other fourteen States.
This is not the way to fight extremism.
I am proud to support such a resolution.
I am voting in favour of it because it is inconceivable that the European Parliament, after its excellent political debate yesterday, should not adopt a stance on this matter.
For me there is no question of allowing them to develop and to flourish without fighting with all our might.
Such a view is not only a political cop-out, it is positively dangerous.
It has no right to do so. Instead of prematurely condemning the FPÖ and the Austrian Government which is being formed, there should first be a critical examination and assessment of the governmental declaration and the party programme and policies of the coalition.
We revealed the hollowness of the republicans who were nationalistic, xenophobic and anti-minority.
He spoke of the task of not isolating Member States but of doing everything to unite them in common European values.
The Austrian People' s Party must accept some historical responsibility for this.
I cannot therefore accept paragraph 4 in the joint resolution, and I cannot vote in favour of the resolution, even though it would be a vote against the extreme right.
Despite these objections of mine to the Council' s action and despite my view that it is better to work for integration than to employ isolating tactics, it was important to show clearly where the European Parliament stands on questions of racism, which is why I voted in favour of the resolution at the final vote.
I wonder on what point of order Mr Davies was speaking.
Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel, let me say how disappointed I am, because I personally thought this problem had been resolved long ago.
Here we are not adding any more sub-items under the 'Human Rights' heading, we are introducing new items.
Relating to Friday: President.
That ought to mean that we have more time on Thursday.
The following objectives were set: improving the development potential of rural areas by calling upon local initiative; promoting the acquisition of knowledge in the rural development sector; disseminating this knowledge to other rural areas.
Urban policy has always been at the forefront of EU policy.
As the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs stressed in its opinion, the Commission must therefore recognise the need to exploit synergies in this context while avoiding duplication of multiple funding.
Secondly, preventing and combating routine urban crime and crime related to drug dealing must start at local level.
We would then be overreaching ourselves.
Hence our amendment in order to prevent contradictions between general policy and actual projects.
INTERREG has always been at the heart of a genuine Community policy for regional planning and a truly polycentric notion of our European territory.
My second concern was that some discriminated groups have specific problems, for example, disabled people' s access to the workplace.
Finally, if the Commission and the relevant Councils of Ministers permit, I should like to stress that the Members of the European Parliament should be given more information on the procedures relating to the implementation of the INTERREG projects and, beyond that, of similar initiatives.
The Commission is allocating 67 million pounds towards the INTERREG III programme, which will be spent on continuing the development of cross-border economic projects between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Even though I approve of the general guidelines of INTERREG III, I feel it is extremely important to ensure better coordination between this programme, financed by the ERDF, and the other external cooperation funds, including in particular the European Development Fund, intended for ACP countries.
No, equality means that we all participate in both working life and family life.
At the beginning it is sometimes a little like chasing a rainbow if we say that a plan is too idealistic.
We have to act now, before it is too late.
Mr President, from this year until the year 2006 around EUR 200 billion is available for the Structural Funds, but only 5¾ % is set aside for the Community initiatives, INTERREG, LEADER, URBAN and EQUAL.
How are priorities supposed to be set here?
This concern, ladies and gentlemen, lies at the very heart of our URBAN initiative, and I am willing to rewrite the text, if necessary, in order to make this message clearer yet.
Some speakers wanted it to be less bureaucratic, more transparent, and to avoid redundancy in terms of the projects and funding.
Fourth observation: the European Observatory and the possible use of a technical assistance office.
In response I can only say that this already exists.
Finally, under point 20 the motion for a resolution contains seven specific proposals for amendments to the guidelines.
Thank you, Mr Medina Ortega.
I feel that the French authorities - which have the honour of housing the European Parliament in Strasbourg - should be aware of their responsibility to ensure adequate connections with all the capitals of the Union.
Mr Corbett, I have not received any notification.
We must increase our efficiency in this area. We must reopen the Danube to boats.
You have seen yourself as the guardian of the Treaties, and that is indeed your role.
Last week, the new Minister for Finance of the Austrian coalition described the Austrian Parliament as a farce and a theatre.
Those of us who have had to live under a dictatorship know of the existence of dictatorships with cardboard governments.
I believe that this is the first objective for us to pursue.
The perfect illustration of this crippling flaw lies in the opening sentence of the Commission communication.
This extreme difficulty in seeing the contradictions of the current situation and, where necessary, confronting these is seriously limiting the will, duly confirmed by Mr Prodi, to grant public demands.
This governance therefore needs to be a sensitive governance so that we can actually work together and understand that each of the institutions in the European Union, has its relevant role to play.
The document mentions common values on different occasions.
Areas such as security, the World Trade Conference, food safety, but also the new economy, require more action, therefore, from the European Commission.
(Applause)
In doing so, we need, no less, to reinvent the European Union, but without destroying the present Union.
It must clearly be accepted that the people should be free to make their decisions at the level which best combines the objective conditions of an immediate, fair and transparent democratic debate, namely at national level in the main.
Your Commissioners are clearly not solely responsible for this.
They are free to choose only between your brave new world and denouncement.
However, out of all the points, two specifically require our attention, and they are closely linked: peace and stability within Europe and outside Europe.
Precise application of this principle can only reinforce the actions taken and give our citizens a clear view of each level of competence.
However, saying is one thing and doing is another!
The Union must not take on a whole range of new tasks without the basic foundation for a successful European economy being in place.
Madam President, Mr Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, at the time of our vote on your appointment we invited you to come here today.
From your speech I will concentrate on what you have called the new governance, which you will use as a tool for reconciliation with our fellow citizens.
We must be brave and not only see some aspects of globalisation. We must be brave enough to have more of an overview of this process, so that wealth does not only benefit the most highly-developed blocks and countries, but that there is also harmonious change and development in every region in the world.
You said in your summary, Commissioner Prodi, that liberalisation, competitiveness, keeping inflation low, innovation, science and technology are central for the future success of the European economy and creating jobs.
Just a few main points.
Nor was any mention made of information policy and communications catering to the needs of our citizens.
There is nothing new in your work programme.
In your work programme for 2000 you state something quite clever. You say that environmental considerations must be integrated into all other policy areas.
That is what we expect of you in the next five years.
Are reducing the disparities between levels of development and the consequent promotion of real convergence objectives that we have already achieved?
This document leaves out issues which clearly should have been included.
Yet the standard call for a fund for refugees, financed from the Community budget, is there.
In cross-border cooperation, greater emphasis must be placed on improving the conditions for the economic activity of the small and medium-sized undertakings which are the job creators.
We also agree with the rapporteur about asking for more attention to be paid to small and medium-sized undertakings and, of course, about refusing to use outside service providers.
A programme such as INTERREG is there precisely to support regional development projects across national borders, projects which make it possible to build centres of economic growth at European level which will be able to take up the challenge from our competitors on a global scale.
Our position on LEADER is a product of our more general assessment of the EU' s overall agricultural policy.
The actual appropriations available for LEADER + compared with LEADER 2 are smaller despite their increase by 15% (from EUR 1 775 million for LEADER 2 to EUR 2 020 million for LEADER +).
Unless this CAP is overthrown, no programme can ensure the survival of small and medium-scale farmers and the social and economic regeneration of the countryside.
However, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has voted unanimously on some important amendments to the Commission proposal.
The regulation proposed by the Commission conceals the danger of creating a marketing monopoly for certain additives.
I should like to take this opportunity to stress how important it is that, in future, all the directives are dealt with under Article 152, since both food safety and environmental issues require a coherent policy and a comprehensive overview.
I am sure that the Commission can accept the report which, as you know, was approved unanimously in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
We do not have another law at the moment, and until we do, we must deal with genetically-modified micro-organisms as and when we pass legislation; we must include them as an add-on and insist that they be labelled.
Five amendments have been presented by Parliament.
A number of you made reference - Mr Nicholson in particular - to the issue surrounding labelling.
It is being addressed and will be addressed in a comprehensive way, particularly in Directive 90/220.
This issue is before Parliament at the moment and there will be other directives dealing it, which will also come under the legal base of Article 152 which gives Parliament full competence in the areas of codecision.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it was and always will be one of life' s mysteries, one of the unsolved riddles of the follow-up to the BSE crisis, that we still have no Community rules for the control of scrapie in sheep.
As a farmer myself, I am most concerned that consumer health should not be put at risk.
I should also like to thank Mr Böge for his work on this issue.
Thank you, Commissioner.
We will either be able to restore water quality to suit the planet' s ecosystem or we will experience a whole range of adverse events which will threaten the development of certain regions, the living conditions of the inhabitants of other regions and even, more fundamentally, the global balance.
The majority of the amendments approved by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection meet these objectives. I hope they will be supported by this House.
I would have to ask them what chemicals they are putting into the water supply at the moment and why they are not broadcasting to all the residents in that area exactly what they are doing.
This is something that they prefer to avoid doing.
The chemical industry and, unfortunately, the European Commission and the Council of Ministers too want to draft a separate risk analysis for each dangerous substance.
Fifthly, the protection of groundwater status and measures against persistent pollution of the groundwater should be transparent and clear.
In the EU, this is a crucial issue in the Mediterranean region and also in other European countries where we are witnessing the gradual drying of wet areas.
We are not, fortunately, at this point.
With the framework directive on water policy, we are hoping to end the fragmentation of the EU' s water legislation.
However, Mrs Lienemann' s report also says that the river basins receiving the transferred water must save and protect their water.
May I take this opportunity to remind you that previous resolutions concerning the Nitrates Directive have still not been implemented in all Member States, in spite of the fact that there is a common EU resolution.
This cannot be done, and it also, in any case, goes against nature.
They have opted for the weak common position in favour of our Parliament' s more drastic positioning.
If I may make a suggestion, Commissioner Barnier, would it be possible for the communication to say something more on this subject, in addition to the straightforward and slightly clinical phrase which indicates that it will be carried out in conjunction with the European Parliament?
I forgot to mention my intention to go before the national parliaments, as I have already done, not only by meeting their representatives here but by going to see them in situ.
I was in Mitrovica a couple of months ago, I saw the situation there for myself.
We hope that this important Cologne Council decision will become a reality.
The values at stake are too central, too fundamental for us to accept dithering or compromises.
If any concrete case of persistent violation of human rights perpetrated by the government of one Member State occurs, we will be entirely capable to react and to act accordingly.
Is this the text which you will be submitting, or an amendment to the original version?
Our policy is to encourage the recruitment of women to administrative posts in order to create a reserve of suitable candidates for future promotion to managerial positions.
.
We cannot hand out money with one hand and, with the other, take countries to court, where they may well be fined.
This is all I can say.
However, I am obliged to respect the national authority with which I must conduct these negotiations.
Finally, on large-scale energy transmission networks, the guidelines also provide for financial participation from the Funds to develop these networks where this helps to reduce dependency on an external supplier or to combat the effects of isolation.
When an autonomous region's or country's funding from European structural funds increases, the state makes a concomitant reduction in central funding to that region, so that the total funding package available matches a formula set nationally without regard to the quantum of structural funds granted by the Union.
This is why I find it also difficult to meet Mr Medina halfway and respond to his question.
Instead of 2004, it should, of course, be 1 July 2000.
The matter of excise taxes, to which the honourable Member is referring, is the prerogative of the Member State concerned.
Once again, towards the end of this year, the Commission will forward a report on the state of affairs on excise taxes, and I am obviously available for any discussion with Parliament on that report.
I am not speaking so much for myself, as I happen to be one of those few lucky people in Europe who can drink water directly from their own lake at home.
Amendments Nos 4. 49 and 87 would not be acceptable because they would restrict the ability of a country to move water from where it is in supply to where it is needed, be that arid areas or urban areas.
The ecologically sustainable transfer of water must not be restricted by Union acts.
But only when each country has done its utmost to conserve its water resources, when literally everything has been done that could have been done in our own countries, only then, in my view, should it be necessary to start thinking in terms of harmonising water usage.
However, I must say that I am not over-pleased because I believe that this directive is not of great quality, it is going to be very difficult to implement and has many shortcomings.
With regard to costs, I would like clarification of what costs we are talking about.
As for us, we our bound by the terms of the texts: a maximum of four months.
Parliament has proposed EUR 850 million, but the document repeats the initial proposal of EUR 613 million.
Is this not a contradiction?
In many areas the parks which are a fundamental element in the LIFE programme have been established.
As far as this is concerned, the report, albeit a component, may well be the key component of Lisbon, because it is really innovative, while many other things are merely a rumination of what has been said before.
Within my group, it speaks for itself that social protection forms an important part of this social cohesion and should thus also be added to the agenda in Lisbon.
It has the advantage of clarity, and it can collect data and exchange experiences in order to agree on objectives and finely tune solid, comparative indicators and put forward recommendations.
The Member States can devise their own systems in the social sphere, each within the framework of its economic resources and political preferences.
It is most especially important not to create unnecessary problems before the enlargement of the EU.
This is why, when it comes to social protection, we are opposed to schemes copied from the Luxembourg process which run counter to this rationale: broad economic guidelines, then convergence criteria and, finally, social issues, dealt with as the last resort.
That is something we would do well to recognise.
It seems to me, Commissioner, that the Commission has the responsibility to promote and coordinate these opportunities.
The problem has been overcome.
Interpreting Article 7 of the Treaty, we can conclude that the application of protection for reproduction does not only mean protection for the reproduction of the interpretations or performances themselves as such that are embodied in recordings, but also protection against copying, whether in whole or in part and whether permanent or temporary, and protection against any other form of production.
We finally got here, on Monday at 8.30 p.m., after some of us had spent more than 12 hours travelling.
Mr President, I would just like to draw your attention to something that concerns today' s agenda.
Let me start by saying something about the successfully concluded negotiations between the EU and ACP countries.
This is very much the line also just presented by Minister Amado.
We want to talk about coherence.
I would like to give you a few examples to illustrate these contradictions.
The meeting held in that North American city demonstrated that globalisation is having seriously unbalanced and negative effects on poorer countries.
Is the Council discussing this issue?
These figures are from before the Internet revolution took off.
I would just say to the Commissioner that I hope his proposal will be successfully adopted by the Commission and the Member States. I would also ask the Commissioner to give some concrete examples of sectoral interests which are holding matters up, not only in the Commission but also in the Member States.
We believe that this is absolutely vital, failing which we will be unable to take any consistent action as regards the coherence of policies, and we cannot do this without giving development policies their rightful place as an instrument for upholding the principles and values underpinning Europe' s status in the international system.
The United States of America will be tabling a draft resolution on China at the 56th session of the Human Rights Commission and are putting pressure on the European Union to support this draft resolution.
That does not suggest any lack of commitment to the improvement of human rights but it does indicate the usual concern to get our approach right so that we really make a difference.
Chinese leaders are in no doubt about our position on all these issues and on developments in Tibet.
But the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 4, 9, 11, 13, 15, 19, 23, 39, 40, 41, 49, 51, 59, 61, 64, 66, 70, 71, 72, 74, 77, 83, 87, 90, 91, 92, 95, 97, 98, 81(rev.), 100, 101, 103 and 107.
The contribution that the projects supported by LIFE make to the sustainability of social and economic activities, and thus job creation.
Böge report (A5-0023/2000)
Stenzel report (A5-0034/2000)
The Socialist Group has now changed its mind and this is why the report is not as clear as it would have been.
However, this report, although probably inspired by the best intentions, occasionally takes a direction which I feel is highly dangerous in that it tends to erase notions of citizenship and legality and turns a multiplicity of exceptions into the common law on which the Community approach is based.
a shorter timescale is needed for implementing the directive.
The Council hopes to achieve good quality groundwater within 16 years, but the Commission wants no further deterioration in the chemical status of groundwater so that good quality groundwater can be achieved in 10 years.
This type of project complies with the principle of regional cohesion and solidarity, which we have always defended, and, as such, should enjoy the widespread support of the European Union in the context of the promotion of trans-European networks and regional policy (through the Structural Funds).
.
Cooperation on these matters within the framework of the EU should create added value, based on the exchange of experiences and the reciprocal evaluation of the way in which policies are developing, the aim being to define best practice.
Health care, child care and care of the elderly are clear examples of areas which are not obviously transnational.
Mr President, I regret the absence of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council. This is a Council declaration, and I believe that it would perhaps have been useful for them to have been present for the rest of the debate.
That is what we hope for and is the cordial message that we are sending our governments, even if it goes against their interests.
It is probable, therefore, that there is a lot of life out there, and much of it much more advanced than we are.
Such policy should comprise various components.
Both in Rwanda and Kosovo, the UN, despite the many warnings, appeared to be overtaken by events and stood by as a helpless observer of the massacres, as President Havel pointed out this afternoon.
I cannot shake off the impression that, when it comes to human rights, despite all the rhetoric, Africa does not feature on top of the agenda of the Portuguese Presidency.
Europe puts the rebels in the South under pressure to negotiate and at the same time, Americans isolate the regime and support the rebels at military level.
Only then can we follow in the footsteps of the founders of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
In an extraordinarily edifying speech, characterised by wisdom, historical knowledge, an understanding of the human heart and insight into Europe' s spiritual and Christian heritage, he pointed to sources of inspiration for our work on human justice and human dignity.
The Commission' s analysis has in fact shown that, although classified as high income countries by the World Bank, Cyprus and Malta have the same difficulties as the CEECs in transposing Community law due to their lack of administrative and judicial capacity.
There is, of course, the question of pre-accession aid, and this belongs in category seven.
We all know that special care is needed to ensure that Cyprus is brought successfully into the European Union, and the decisions taken at Helsinki give an added dimension to this debate, with the acceptance of Turkey as a candidate country.
As far as the citizens are concerned, it is what a regulation can do for them that matters.
No, we should continue to make progress by working discreetly to support the special representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations with his remit.
I have had a little to do with this too.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 24 January the Council considered the consequences of the accident the previous month involving the oil tanker Erika.
I am pleased that the Council is considering this question.
The Commission' s intentions in this area are positive, as it intends to reinforce the application of the 1995 directive.
The information that I have is to do with the 1995 directive, which does not include any provisions of that kind.
This means that medical aid is still denied to the Albanian Kosovars.
That was how it was.
I must say that these NATO measures were not taken lightly and were only carried out as a last resort when it became evident that all avenues for reaching a negotiated solution had been exhausted and that the Belgrade authorities were concentrating their forces in order to expel the Kosovo Albanians from their land.
In any case, I have with me a statement made by Prosecutor Del Ponte according to which NATO is not at present under any investigation by the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and there is no formal inquiry process concerning NATO' s actions in the Kosovo conflict.
This is having unfortunate and obvious effects on the scope for controlling inter-ethnic coordination, and we are all conscious that, if measures are not taken in the short term, we may end up with situations involving the kind of tensions that we witnessed just a few hours ago, and that these tensions may be mirrored in other areas of Kosovo.
Some of these actions might have been questionable, and some were regarded as unfortunate by NATO itself, but others were justified for tactical reasons, with the aim of preventing Mr Milosevic from continuing his propaganda campaign within the former Yugoslavia.
Secondly, what does it propose to do about them?
Will the Council treat it as a document that it has to accept as it stands, or will the Council feel free to amend that document?
Question No 10 by (H-0053/00):
Nevertheless, our role as mediator means that we must take account of all current attitudes in the Council and I am sure you are aware, Mr Sjöstedt, that the tax issue poses problems for certain delegations.
We are in the midst of rather sensitive negotiations. This sensitivity is reflected in the way in which the Presidency of the Council of the European Union expresses itself in a specific context in relation to particular situations.
This has an impact of course, because it is read by other members of the Council.
The Joint Assembly should play a leading role in monitoring the enactment of good governance, human rights and democracy in cooperation with the Commission.
Enhanced regional cooperation can help prevent the outbreak of conflicts based on ethnic, economic, social or religious factors, i.e. have a preventive effect.
Yet it is quite clear that even after a transitional period a number of countries will simply be unable to open their markets yet to the chill winds of free trade without wrecking their own domestic economy.
However, while I welcome the renewal of the agreements, what I find most interesting is the new wind blowing through our relationships and finding expression in the balanced nature of the negotiations now drawing to a close.
The participation of local bodies is absolutely essential.
Why has the Council not informed us of this?
It does, however, have the ambition to break free from this image.
It is characteristic that the report congratulates FYROM on the constructive stance it maintained during the NATO attack, eulogises its pacifist role because it allowed its territory to be used as a base for NATO forces, but, of course, remains silent about the indignation of its people, which was manifested by mass demonstrations during the NATO bombardments.
So I welcome Mr Swoboda' s excellent report, especially paragraph 12, which quite clearly maps out a European, an EU, prospect for Macedonia.
The very fact that negotiations are beginning first with FYROM, before all the others, is evidence that we can and do differentiate.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m.
I would ask for that to be checked again.
We will have the chance to scrutinise, to debate, to question. But we will only have the right to formally challenge the Commission if we think it has gone beyond the delegation that we have given to the Commission in the legislation.
We must be very vigilant.
Mr President, the beauty of statistical data is that it is not only reliable but also comparable.
So, once again - and finally - I want to thank you for your help in allowing us to measure stability with greater technical certainty and better comparability.
The denominations of the euro are well known.
It is essential that the decision should now be taken in March.
I believe that this debate shortly before midnight will also teach a salutary lesson to all those counterfeiters who believe their hour has come, because they think the EU is no longer awake at this late hour!
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.
Relevant information must be given to prospective unit-holders in a fund in a language which is readily understandable to investors in the host country.
Mr President, I must firstly thank the rapporteur, Mr Schmidt, my colleague, Mr Goebbels, and Mrs Villiers and Mrs Lulling from my Group. Despite their differing opinions on some points, they have consistently worked in an extremely constructive manner.
Firstly, there is the problem of investment in non-harmonised undertakings falling outside this directive.
I firmly believe that the prudent use of derivatives can help fund secure, safer, higher returns.
Heavy-handedness - a prescription of how private sector managers should invest and where they should invest - will merely reduce returns to savers.
We shall therefore vote cautiously on all amendments limiting recourse to excessively derivative instruments and we shall vote in favour of all amendments which limit the excessive concentration of assets within a single financial group.
But it is time for the legislation to be updated.
Mr Schmidt has done an excellent job here.
Yes, we need to continue to ensure that UCITS provide a balanced and protected product for consumers.
The Commission proposals being debated here will give it the face-lift it needs.
I therefore believe that this is another step forward we can take and I think it would also be a positive move if consumers and investors could be made aware of a fund' s name so as to be able to learn something about its risk profile.
The first proposal extends the number of instruments in which an 'undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities' (UCITS) can invest.
I also endorse the rationale underlying the general maximum percentage of the counterparty risk in Amendments Nos 17, 36 and 45.
Neither are securities lending transactions via securities clearing houses or exchanges - as opposed to the purchase and sale of securities - automatically covered by these institutions.
As regards the question put by Mr Huhne, his reference in the intervention he made this morning is to hedging operations.
We are about to advance into new territory where attitudes and symbols are of great significance.
Mr President, it is our opinion that one facet of the construction of Europe hinges on the construction of a common judicial system, for the Europe that we want to build, which comprises administrative law, civil law, both substantive and procedural, and criminal law, both substantive and procedural.
Crime in the European Union has increased to such an extent that we cannot and must not content ourselves any longer with a step-by-step approach of mutual legal assistance in criminal affairs.
This is a task that has lasted three years, and on which we have been consulted, so to speak, as a matter of course, when this issue, as has already been stressed, comprises highly important formal and substantive facets, which called for a range of assessments, consultations, concerted actions and codecisions.
It would seem to us that the Council has taken the various issues - those of legitimate interceptions, the rights of the defence, the rights of detainees and of the authorities legally empowered to request mutual assistance - a little too lightly.
I personally find it unacceptable, for example, for Mr Pinochet to be given the option to move to Spain for a confrontation.
The Council proposal containing those requirements, ENFOPOL 98 was approved by this Parliament last May in the Schmid report.
We are very concerned about the direction we are taking here without proper public debate within the national parliaments or elsewhere and without the involvement of civil liberties organisations throughout Europe which are extremely concerned about these developments.
In this way, Member States would make themselves very vulnerable and it is doubtful as to whether there are sufficient guarantees to protect the State where interception occurs and the citizens within that State.
I am aware of the problems but I think that these could have been clarified by means of one single change in the text.
This draft convention therefore aims to complete and facilitate the application, at Member State level, of pre-existing conventions on other legal areas. The intention is to improve judicial cooperation in criminal matters through rapid and effective legal assistance while still fully respecting the fundamental rights of the defence and the general principles of human rights enshrined in the national law of the Member States and in the European Convention on Human Rights.
Mr President, as you know, all of our countries abolished the death penalty years ago, but with nearly a thousand suicides a year in our prisons, they have not really abolished it?
We would, on the other hand, like to thank Commissioner Vitorino for attending the debate held in this Chamber.
I do not expect you to wave through or rubber stamp everything you are confronted with in the coming years.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
It rather seems like a contradiction in terms.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
I hope the person who tabled the amendment will agree to this.
Madam President, I would like, with reference to this report, to underline the problem of translation: reference should be made to the French or Italian version, since the text adopted by this Parliament will also be the authoritative one for the Commission.
The harmonisation of criminal law or the introduction of minimum legal standards should not be legitimised against the background of problems of one' s own creation but from considerations of reason and necessity. There is nothing to indicate that the Member States' legal principles, legal traditions and carefully tailored legal systems should be lost for reasons to do with an already familiar offence such as counterfeiting.
It is patently clear that Africa has become the forgotten continent.
The developing countries are asked to fall into line with the liberalisation of trade, despite their vulnerable economies.
.
At a more central level, there is a need for more effective co-ordination between government donors, international NGOs, indigenous NGOs and private sector initiatives so that scarce resources are not wasted.
50% or more of hospital beds are now occupied by someone suffering with an AIDS related disease in the countries where AIDS figures are highest.
The Joint Assembly also represents the tribunal before which the countries of Europe and the developing countries defend their common interests.
Company restructuring is part of the principle of free determination of investments, and must therefore be defended.
Yet the current situation in Europe provides us with clear examples of how jobs are being destroyed, particularly, and most seriously, by companies which are making huge profits.
It is especially important in the case of large international companies where decisions are taken far from the employee.
Specifically, I must stress in this debate the plan for Morocco. This is a country with which the European Union has an effective relationship and common interests and which should take particular priority in mutual cooperation and collaboration.
This is why what seemed to be a local and isolated phenomenon in El Ejido is actually a worrying symptom which is coinciding with the emergence of parties like Haider' s.
B5-0156/2000 by Mr Maaten, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on the fate of a Russian journalist Andrey Babitsky in Chechnya;
Thank you, Mr Staes.
I would therefore ask the Commissioner: can you not in fact do anything to stop us repeating our follies here in Europe?
This is a sign of hope, the hope that it possible to act differently even in Serbia.
We have already talked about the fate of the political prisoners.
Press freedom in Angola
We have established requirements for the countries which want to join our Union and we must also establish requirements for the countries which we support, because we believe in democracy and its values.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I fully support the motion for a resolution being discussed by this House. The repression of both Angolan and foreign journalists in Angola is scandalous and so serious that we cannot let it pass without comment.
We should stop financing this regime and we should certainly stop supplying arms for the war.
There are hardly any reintegration programmes for people who have been relocated to the so-called New Lands.
The water which these people need to exist is under threat because the groundwater strata there are being drilled by a mining company, and this is why the traditional way of life of the people who live there is being threatened.
The relocation scheme was implemented and the Dineh people were moved to an area contaminated by uranium.
The filtration camps are camps in which torture, rape and violations are perpetrated: we know that now.
I am using the phrase 'is said to be' on purpose, because official Chechen sources are still denying that they would have exchanged Mr Babitsky for a number of Russian prisoners of war.
Cambodia
In March of last year, a member of Sam Rengie' s party was killed by a group of men in military uniform in the province of Kandal.
It is a vital precondition for strengthening democratic institutions and civil society.
This is a subject which is not given sufficient attention.
Our general policy however, is to recognise the inherent dignity and the unique contribution of indigenous people to the development and plurality of society, something we are looking at particularly keenly in the context of the northern dimension which we are trying to develop and which we are discussing with North America.
B5-0173/2000 by Mr Papayannakis and Mr Sjöstedt on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left,
Implementing high environmental standards will not only allow important industrial and technological sectors to develop, it will also have social and economic benefits and, at the same time, public health standards will improve.
It is incomprehensible that an accident of this kind could have happened at all today.
This is an important point, as several speakers have suggested.
The real problem is not finding a legal way of slightly complicating redundancy procedures, but banning them.
With the aim of working out a strategy, it is vital to have a reading of these facts which harmonious and as strict as possible, so that we truly make tourism capable of creating jobs.
Having heard many Members who share the view expressed in the opinion, this was a real relief.
This would mean that the EU would unjustly be removing tasks from Member States and that the Brussels bureaucracy would be intervening unnecessarily.
In contrast, at European level it would be possible to look into measures for improving the relations between hotels and Tour Operators, for example a regulation of such relations, the promotion of a special bankruptcy fund, etc., in collaboration with representatives from the two branches.
We all know that this change of heart is basically due to the close cause-effect relationship between tourism and employment. It is also due to the recognition by the European Union, since the 1997 conference on these issues, of the enormous potential, represented by tourism, for employment.
I want to mention, as has already been mentioned by many speakers today, that tourism related to the natural and cultural heritage is expected to be the fastest expanding form of tourism in the EU during the next two decades.
It will give more and better choice to tourists and generate new and better tourist products.
The new strategy outlined by the Commission communication on tourism and employment, and agreed by the Council, places the emphases on tourism gathering and disseminating information and good practice.
We should consider on principle whether there is any point at all in holding these kinds of meetings.
A criticism which is often levelled at the EU and which, to some extent, is justified is that it is involved in far too many areas.
The question is, therefore: what are the demands that a monopoly or part of a service which is governed by a monopoly needs to meet?
I would therefore ask you, Commissioner, to help me in my task as a new Member.
There are postal companies which have a monopoly and are doing a reasonably good job.
Thirdly, it is vital to have, first of all, a universal postal service at an affordable price for all citizens, wherever they may be; secondly, to have a uniform price for all Member States; and thirdly, to have daily mail deliveries and collections on working days.
In our opinion, each one must be free to make its own organisational choices.
If people are to be free to provide services across borders it is only fair and reasonable that we should have European regulations to govern it.
Our older people, even though on social welfare, can enjoy the benefits of travel.
Such companies have always been around, but they used to be banned, whereas these days they are being heralded as progress.
We want our consumers to obtain as much as possible for the wages they are paid.
These impact studies are necessary in order to assess the effects of any untrammelled liberalisation, not just on the economic organisation of the market, but also in terms of its human and social aspects.
Mr President, the postal service is not a normal service provider like a hairdresser' s or a fitness centre.
Mr Purvis, I found your methodologically provocative remark about the tender interesting and certainly worth exploring.
I can only say again that Commissioner Bolkestein will be able to address all the concerns on Monday, in the appropriate committee, more competently and in much more detail.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, on 22 February, ETA struck again in a brutal attack in Spain with the murder of Fernando Buesa Blanco, the General Secretary of the Socialist Party of Vizcaya and the spokesman of the Socialist Party of the Basque Parliament, and Jorge Díez Elorza, his bodyguard.
We in the Basque Country could ask ourselves the same question. Does it really matter if we are Basque or Spanish or European?
You can be what you want to be.
This, Madam President, is the only way forward which we therefore fully support.
They are extremely highly qualified, of a calibre which it is difficult, if not impossible, to find in the individual national administrations because of the nature of the recruitment methods and criteria used.
For this reason, we are reforming the administrative machinery in order to create the necessary conditions for us to be able to carry out our work efficiently.
Have you really taken into account the changes in staff structure that new information technology will bring about, because those will be fundamental in the new direction of these reforms.
Irresponsibility because the feeling exists in some quarters that there will not be sufficient control and discipline.
Indeed the Court of Auditors has called it fiction.
Change will have to come in any case, change would imply a transition period because there is no possibility of any system being invented that could enable us to move from one Friday to the next Monday from one system to another.
Excessive paperwork.
The fifteen countries have appointed diplomatic experts at ambassador level in order to tackle one of the most important issues which we will face in the coming months.
I must thank Commissioner Patten who is here today for his support and the tremendous energy that he has also invested in trying to ensure that all these issues could be settled in such a short time.
The first type will be operations in which European forces are involved within the framework of NATO.
When it comes to the Balkans and Kosovo, I also hope that the Council will comply with Parliament' s and, as I understand it, also the Commission' s demands for a multiannual budget for operations in Kosovo.
He was just as pleased and pleasantly surprised as yourself at the fact that it had been possible to agree about so much.
A foreign policy presupposes that one has a clear definition of oneself and of one' s own interests.
But these are always the words that those who conduct preventative wars use to justify their actions.
The Portuguese presidency has made great progress in establishing a series of provisional or interim bodies.
That is why this job went to Mr Solana, the Secretary-General of NATO, who is also guilty of the crimes committed against Yugoslavia; the right man for the right job, against whom charges have been filed, calling for him to be tried as a war criminal.
I believe that we will have to reach a compromise in this area between those who, rightly, are pushing for the communitisation of this policy and those who think that such advances should be the responsibility of the Intergovernmental Conference.
Additionally, and this is for me the most important area of all, an area where we are breaking new ground, we will, soon after we have put forward our proposals on a rapid reaction facility, be bringing forward proposals as well on non-military headline goals.
I have heard promises that we will establish a stability pact in the southern Caucuses.
Even in countries such as Germany and Belgium, which have specific legal commitments on the representation of the two sexes, the involvement of women on various committees is no more than 18%. What we need, therefore, is to promote specific policies.
I do hope that the Commissioner will have the necessary perseverance to also produce the necessary reforms within the Commission - but then, of course, she is young and full of energy.
Today, we are focusing upon the ways in which more women might be able to participate in the decision-making process.
In my own country, Sweden, a number of political parties have, in recent years, voluntarily introduced quota allocation by gender as a feature governing the ways in which political assemblies are constituted and run.
What happens when more women take an active and equal part in political decision making?
In anticipation of this request being met, I now want to take the opportunity of wishing all socialist women success with the "Women' s World Marches" which are to begin this spring on International Women' s Day.
The vast majority of them are not members of any party.
On the one hand, if we establish quotas for women, why do we also not create quotas according to age or ethnic group, quotas of Catholics, of workers, of those who wear glasses.
We know that this area is proving more difficult to resolve, both because women still bear the main responsibilities in family life and because there is still prejudice and personal interest standing in the way of genuine participation by women in various areas which involve greater responsibility.
It is quite logical, it is consistent!
But when it comes to important decisions and priorities, there is a lack of women' s voices.
The government of Mozambique has appealed for humanitarian aid from third countries.
The international community including the United States of America, Switzerland, South Africa, Ireland, Norway, Denmark, Italy, Sweden and the Netherlands have to date provided substantial assistance.
These NGOs will address the most urgent need which is to move people in danger to more secure areas as well as providing health care, water and sanitation.
And this is happening in a country which, because it is one of the poorest in the world, does not have the minimal essential resources to help those affected as quickly as necessary.
Are we ready to pay for those resources?
Thank you, Mrs Kinnock.
Faced with this challenge the Commission recommended essentially that our economic policy merely should prolong our past stance which limits itself to setting right the monetary and fiscal fundamentals of the economy while for the rest putting faith in the markets to work their miracle without any further intervention by conscious social agents.
It has been my proposal that Parliament must recommend an activist economic policy consisting of two main parts.
A tremendous amount of work remains to be done in the field of transport, energy saving and even in substituting travel by communication via the Internet.
But we have the impression that this growth, sustained firstly by the performance of the United States, and then by the productivity gains of the new economy, by the new information and communication technologies, is driven by the general world situation, even despite our handicaps.
The debate and vote here in plenary ought to correct this.
We all agree that the current economic conjuncture is good.
With the review of the common fisheries policy due in 2002, it is important that swift progress is now made.
The other replaces a reference to income from sales and other revenue, subsidies, interest received, etc., with a reference simply to volume of sales.
The Northern Ireland fishing industry has received many hard blows from this Union.
All will be beneficial, not just in relation to ISA but in achieving better standards in aquaculture generally where required.
It can, nevertheless, in the affected fish, lead to severe weight loss and early death in its advanced stages and it therefore has had a serious economic impact on the whole Scottish aquaculture sector costing the industry around EUR 60 to 70 million in losses arising from the mandatory premature culling and other eradication measures.
For the others, well, we would have time to see what would happen, according to local circumstances.
Before we jump to copy the slaughter policy of the Norwegians, we should try these other things first to see if we can mitigate the disaster.
The Commission' s services are drawing up implementing rules in order to ensure the practical application of this instrument.
The minimum size must be respected and technical measures must be implemented if we are to eliminate the zero age.
However, I also agree with Mr Gallagher who felt bound to indicate his frustration at the tardiness of the Commission in getting into gear and transforming the recommendations into Community law.
Our rapporteur' s criticisms on this point have also therefore been heeded.
The relationship between fisheries and marine ecosystems is obvious.
Our committee avoided embarrassing itself by making a series of amendments of which I tabled 14, many of which were accepted by the rapporteur for which I thank him sincerely.
Yet I must say that I disagree with many of his proposals because I am with those who believe that it is not just resources which are important in the fisheries sector but also the human beings who have been carrying out this activity for centuries.
This particularly applies, however, to our own coastal waters.
This House will today approve a very important and appropriate joint motion for a resolution tabled by several groups.
The polluter pays principle must be applied consistently.
The regulations which we are drawing up today in Europe should be regarded as a precedent.
Mrs de Palacio expressed her views at length regarding this issue and I feel she set to work without waiting for an element which today is absolutely essential, a draft European maritime law, following a draft directive on the maritime transportation of dangerous goods.
From this point of view, this fits in with the wish of the French to see their presidency characterised by regulations which work towards increasing safety.
Confronted with this situation, the inhabitants of Brittany, the Vendée and Charente, as well as the forestry workers in other regions, await a signal from the European Union.
I took very careful note of Commissioner Fischler' s remarks, perhaps the most practical suggestions we have heard to date.
Our demand is not selectively applicable and the Commission should therefore regard this as a suggestion to look into the use of Community funds in regions around Israel.
Therefore, because it is not an easy and simple issue, we have to be cautious and we have to be careful.
Hence we withdraw our signature to Amendment No 4.
It is, however, recognised that other species such as trout, eels or herring, may be carriers of the virus without being affected by it.
On average, one quarter of Member State governments are composed of women and a little over one fifth of their parliaments.
We are opposed to the idea that the biological differences between men and women should give rise to two different world views and two different value systems.
Why do we think that investment should not be used as an instrument for managing demand but should rather be practised for its own sake?
Joint resolution on the shipwreck of the (RC B5-0181/2000)
This basis must include minimum conditions for access to Community waters and ports with regard to the age and characteristics of vessels; a general principle of environmental responsibility making it possible to determine the liability of the various operators, and particularly that of the charterer, and to impose heavy penalties.
We agree that the fishing industry has the most to gain from promoting respect for the marine environment.
We have been through a tough period, but I can assure you that there is nothing unrealistic in this goal.
A basis for all this is created through education and training, and research, however.
In the achievement of our goal we wish to stress the importance of the European model of society, and, at the same time, the notion that it cannot be a rigid, stagnant system, one based on advantages gained in society, but it must be one that develops as society changes.
I would ask whether this would be fair to countries less developed than ours, as this would create a brain drain for them.
But they are used in a passive way.
It is our opinion that it is not only necessary to change this state of affairs, but that it is also possible to do so.
Basically, as far as we are concerned, we need to adopt macroeconomic political measures which are based on stimulating demand, on public investment and on respect for improved public services. These measures should be geared towards full employment and guarantee a rate of employment of around 75% by 2010.
You might think that a country would wish to limit unemployment by means of public investment, but that is prohibited.
As early as the mid-nineties, Mr Bangemann promised a huge increase in jobs due to the information society.
Secondly, it means a strategy to make drastic cuts in working time and redistribute work between men and women.
Of course, we have in place macro-economic cooperation, the so-called Cologne process, and we have a process for employment, the Luxembourg process. What will this Summit actually add to this?
According to current dogma, salary increases must remain well below increases in productivity, or inflation will rise again.
Or have industrialisation, nuclear power and biotechnology led to greater justice in the past?
Another is the process of actually having a genuine single market - which we still do not yet have - and skills training that will be the key to delivering that innovative and knowledge-driven society.
I also welcome the support which Portugal is receiving from the Commission, not least through the communication which seeks to develop the Community into an information society for everyone.
And then, underlying this decision-making process at European level, there is another crusade to be fought, and one which each of us must embark upon within our own Member States, since it is pointless laying down fine policy guidelines if the budgetary discussions that we enter into within our Member States fail to accommodate these guidelines.
Lastly, a final word on social cohesion.
We know that this requires a proactive approach and that we can count on your determination.
But I would like to add that, if Lisbon wants to become a real social summit, we must also be able to spell out our plans to modernise and reinforce social security.
That would give you another ally for your policy.
As President Guterres reminded us, it is true that we do not intend to introduce new processes in Lisbon, but rather to combine those decided upon in Luxembourg, Cardiff and Cologne.
However, unregulated globalisation, which is what we have today, or globalisation in which large sections of the world' s population do not benefit from significant investment in people, is also a factor in exclusion, in division and in widening the gap between rich and poor.
Mr President, this is a particularly important regulation given that it can no longer be said that 'we are destroying the environment' - we have done this for long enough already - instead it is now almost true to say that 'the environment is destroying us' !
Much has indeed been said of pollution and the effects of pollution, but this proliferation of natural disasters was evident in Central America and Venezuela at the end of last year, and can now be seen in Mozambique and Madagascar.
I hardly need to emphasise the importance of tropical forests at a global level given their influence on climate patterns, the large proportion of the world's biodiversity that is contained within them and of course their importance to the livelihoods of millions in developing countries - fuel wood being an obvious example.
The regulation also makes specific reference to the needs of indigenous and forest-dependent people and the need for gender considerations to be taken into account.
Comitology - the Commission supports in principle Amendment No 11 but prefers the wording of Amendments Nos 13, 14 and 15.
And therein lies the difference with the Council, which is saying that a contribution has to be made.
This is an extraordinarily important report.
It also obliges ships to notify the port that they are going to deliver waste prior to their arrival in the port, and to pay the cost of the reception facilities.
The debate is closed.
Justification for the prompt reform of the directive is provided by something that happened recently in Finland.
Because of this I am glad that the report is not actually controversial and that Parliament is once again proving to be the driving force in the debate about traffic safety on Europe's roads.
The groups have emphatically asked me to urge you not to let the vote take place at 12.00 p.m. but tomorrow instead, as they have not had the chance to apply for split and roll-call votes.
If you want to bring about the great turning point you mentioned, Mr President of the Commission, then you had better make a start on this damn quickly.
It is because we want to give more purpose and prominence to this procedure that the ELDR intends not to sign the current eight-page list - not because we object to the contents, but because we think this is in danger of becoming an annual ritual performance without substance and real meaning.
The programme submitted to us for this year is generous, to say the least.
This shows a general decline in working conditions in a number of important sectors.
Today, a proposal for a directive on electrical and electronic waste has been announced.
In contrast, the five-year plan involves radical centralisation, through which responsibility for new legislative areas - of which there are many - will pass from the national and regional parliaments of the Member States to Mr Prodi' s Commission in Brussels, with legislation being adopted on the basis of 62 out of 87 votes in the Council.
Under the heading of 'democracy' , democracy is being dismantled.
I stand by my words. Here is my signature to the transparency that was promised' .
We know that there are funds available in TACIS and ECHO within the European Union.
I hope that President Prodi will now commit himself to resolving this problem once and for all, and that, in any event, Parliament will always be connected with the legislative procedure for incorporating the recommendations of international fishing organisations into Community legislation.
Mr President, the previous Commission worked under the motto "do less in order to do better" , as opposed to the supposedly active approach of the Delors Commission.
Allow me to give you an example, since the speaking time allotted to me does not give me much opportunity to expand on this idea.
Please, can we have detailed proposals in the next three months about how this will happen.
Looking at it from the point of view of social and employment policy we certainly do not have a legislative programme before us.
She had worked in a range of European countries for high technology companies.
In moulding a greater Europe we have a significant challenge, but mobility in Europe - student mobility for instance - is still very low.
Again, we need a programme of education that matches the best practice across the whole of Europe.
I do not see the work programme make any mention whatsoever of tourism.
It requires improvement as a matter of urgency, but nothing is happening.
As Mr Poettering has already mentioned today, it also has a pivotal role as guardian of the treaties.
Hence I urge the Commission to uphold its role as guardian of the treaties in these matters too, and to remain vigilant.
Today' s speeches reveal a precise, but ruthless analysis.
If a victory is achieved, one should be able to enjoy it too.
They called for impact studies to come into force before the directive itself can take effect or all manner of additional labelling over and beyond the double labelling on the packet which is provided here for the consumers.
At first reading, Parliament got involved in a dangerous procedure of accepting the directive subject to certain conditions.
As for the developing countries, I want to say that, if Britons, Scandinavians and others are not allowed to eat the chocolate they ate as children, they would certainly eat marshmallows or jelly babies instead on a Saturday evening.
They are all of tropical origin and produced in ACP countries.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
(The vote was postponed until the following day)
This responsibility is a historical one, primarily, and is related to the commitments made by Member States to the countries where the bulk of the tropical forest is located.
We can only applaud the proposed European directive which would make it possible to apply these principles.
If the port facilities were in fact financed (at a high level) only by the vessels actually using them, then there would be grounds for fearing that many vessels would avoid these charges, since dumping waste at sea would prove less costly.
A binding Charter is an indispensable requirement and a necessary part of a much-needed constitution.
I hope that we are to have a modernised version of the wording of Article 6 of the Council of Europe' s convention in which our already existing rights are listed in a summarised and concentrated form, with modern biotechnology and data protection added.
This is why there is still a need to give the equal treatment principle a firm basis in law across the board.
Fundamental rights are recognised in our constitutions.
This is a major issue for the guaranteeing of fundamental freedoms in the twenty-first century.
This Charter is important because, although we do have other conventions and treaties, human rights are always under threat, even within the Union.
The governments, and, on their behalf, the Council of Cologne, left the question open.
To say we need a constitution is not to say that the European Union should have the constitution of a state, for the Union is not a state and is not about to become one.
I am therefore pleased that my amendment concerning human dignity - unique to each person, yet common to all and inviolable - obtained support in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, for we must establish a common view of human beings as the effective basis for the EU' s urgent, global fight against the death penalty, its struggle on the side of life and also its fight against torture, against the sex trade and against sexual exploitation.
The third danger is that it may become a general Charter containing a loose set of average values, a mechanism for subverting the advanced human rights which have been acquired in various countries.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, fundamental rights, citizens, freedom and human rights have a long tradition in Europe.
A question that has already been asked here today is what makes us want to join together and to transcend our enormous diversity by creating an entity which will unite us all.
The Commission is keeping strictly to the areas of jurisdiction which are already available to the European Community.
Let me take VAT as an example. in this matter, we are confronted with an important part of Community legislation which has been developed since the 1970s.
For the remainder, unanimity shall remain the general rule.
You said that wherever we require unanimity, we shall retain unanimity, and wherever qualified majority voting is required, we shall use qualified majority voting.
This is why Mr Monti, a few months ago, and now my fellow Commissioner, Frits Bolkestein, continue to make it a political priority.
We wish to initiate this debate, and to fuel and feed it on the basis of these proposals, as I undertook, in order to facilitate to some extent, the difficult negotiations within the Intergovernmental Conference.
They have a great deal to contribute to this important work.
However, since you mention the problem of the pollution of the Danube, I should like to ask a supplementary question: you are obviously well aware of the recent accusations by the Romanian Minister for the Environment, Mrs Lilian Mara, who maintains, and many of us share this view, that the ecological damage caused to the Danube by the NATO bombings is far worse than the damage caused by the recent leak of cyanogen.
As far as the financial aspect is concerned, the Commission is in the process of looking into which funds could be made available for an emergency aid package.
The initiative was drawn up immediately after the Singapore Conference, when the Council invited the Commission to make proposals in favour of the least developed countries, both for immediate action and additional medium-term action.
Let me remind Mr Clegg, if necessary, that, in consideration of its service-related aspects, the agreement on China' s accession would in any case be subject, in principle, to the consultation procedure envisaged under Article 300.
I am therefore perfectly willing, as always, to discuss this matter in somewhat greater depth with the relevant parliamentary committee.
My question, however, concerns concrete matters and the substance of this agreement.
In your question, which I answered, you asked what enlargement will cost.
Subject: Balance between fisheries agreements in the North and South The Fisheries Council of October 1997 analysed the imbalance between fisheries agreements in the North and South, given that shipowners fishing under agreements with countries of the South are increasingly required to co-finance the agreements, which are free of charge for shipowners in the case of the North.
Subject: Compatibility of special export aid with Community law Following the devastation caused by the storm which struck western Europe in December 1999, the forestry sector is in a particularly serious plight.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a few days ago, the Commission had dealings with the French Government over the state aid that France wishes to grant the forestry industry for the purpose of repairing the tremendous damage caused by the storms of December last year.
Today, the works on the road route are already under way.
And it goes without saying that this also applies to the awarding of an environmental label in the European Union.
In Scandinavia, which perhaps has what is at present the most efficient eco-labelling system, there are now already a number of eco-labels complementing, and operating fairly well alongside, each other.
We are therefore especially pleased that the idea of a more commercial form of organisation has been abandoned.
At first reading, considerable improvements were made to the Commission proposal thanks to a great deal of support.
Moreover, the common position suggests an NOx limit value for the incineration of dangerous waste for the year 2007. Such a thing does not yet currently exist.
Again in contrast to Mrs Grossetête, I want, moreover, to say that the levels set here for emissions are realistic. They are technologically feasible and they are, in actual fact, already being applied in a number of the Member States.
This issue, however, should form an exception.
Only a reckless short-term vision and the pursuit of quick profits can explain why attempts are still being made to weaken this directive.
Given a task to do, Mr Blokland has produced a new and revised report that has certainly exceeded anything that we have done before.
We have one of the highest landfill records in Europe.
There are said to be several thousand of these, and the full effect of applying the controls outlined in the directive would be to put up the costs for each incinerator to operate by an estimated £200 000.
Can the Commissioner say when an opportunity for revising the directive to introduce these exceptions - supposing Parliament would ever agree to them - might arise, and does it feel that such an exception for animal waste and for the burning of empty pesticide containers in on-farm incinerators would in fact be likely to gain acceptance?
I think the matter should either go back to the Committee or the Council' s common position, at least its main features, should be adhered to.
Only Finland has already embarked on perfectly feasible practices, as you have heard this evening.
We need the specialist toxic waste incinerators.
I think this mix-up has been due to a misunderstanding between the Department of the Environment and the Ministry of Agriculture in Britain, who thought there were only sixty incinerators of this type when in fact there are several thousand.
Amendments Nos 3, 16, 30 and 33-35 are not compatible with the directive' s structure and cannot therefore be approved.
The legacy of past decades is going to take some time to put right, however.
In that way, we would finally be able to reach a point where critical levels and loads are not exceeded and everyone will be protected effectively from all known health effects of air pollution.
The UN ECE ceilings were agreed by all our Member States, by the applicant countries and globally, in a protocol signed at Gothenburg as recently as November 1999.
In this connection, I would once more urge the Council to produce a common position on large furnaces as a matter of urgency.
Upon examination of the table with the different ceilings for each Member State, however, I get the impression that there are double standards.
However, to begin let me say the following: the FFH directive is an important directive and creates a new climate in Europe for the protection of nature, the environment and birds.
I also find it encouraging that the Commission is consequently taking care that EU legislation is being implemented.
For example, if a Minister goes down on his knees, cut his wrists and writes a pledge in letters of blood that he will deliver the habitats directive in full within an agreed timetable, is she prepared to assist the region and provide structural funding in such circumstances?
In following up the letter sent to Member States by Commissioners Wulf-Mathies and Bjerregaard on June 23 1999, the Commission will insist that, in the programming documents for the period 2000-2006, there must be a firm and irrevocable commitment guaranteeing that the programmes are consistent with the protection of sites under Natura 2000.
This includes in particular excepting specific situations and with respect to the principle of proportionality - possible recourse to the provisions of the Structural or Cohesion Fund regulations in relation to the suspension of payments.
We are determined, after years of foot-dragging by the previous Conservative Government - Mrs Jackson's party - to meet our requirements in the UK, in good faith, to follow the proper legal and proper consultation to ensure this directive is complied with.
Therefore, I fail to understand or accept the linkage that is trying to be established through this resolution.
So does this mean that we will not approve the operational programmes to answer your question?
(The sitting was closed at 12.09 a.m.)
We must ask for some consistency between the countries of Europe if we want to make a genuine stand for human rights.
Speaking today on the 50th anniversary of the Geneva Convention on the protection of human rights, both during and in the aftermath of war, I deeply regret finding myself in the difficult position of having to say that this Convention' s downfall has come about on the continent of Europe itself.
But let us think just of a few people in order to bring home the horror and suffering.
It must prove itself to be a community of values.
The debate is closed.
We need increased coordination, not just between the institutions of the EU, but also between the EU and the Member States.
Reports from the UN claim that, every year, more women die from the effects of violence in the home than as a result of traffic accidents, malaria, cancer or war put together.
Quantitatively, because it affects several million people and qualitatively, because the very existence of this extremely diversified people is at stake.
I also back the rapporteur' s decision to deal extensively with the women' s rights issue.
It is hardly surprising that in Africa, more women than men are infected with the AIDS virus.
Within the European Union, female circumcision must be made a punishable offence.
This is not a matter of tradition or culture, it is one of the basic human rights.
Science, technology and communication have broadened man' s knowledge and expertise and abilities beyond belief.
European foreign policy is too easily thrown off course by purely economic interests.
I would like to say something else on the subject of this report, regarding the right of Europeans to their own identity.
We must make it clear that Europe does have a cultural identity, based on our Greek and Judo-Christian heritages and on enlightenment, which enters freely into dialogue with other identities.
My Group did not have any reason to table any more amendments.
That is the political strategy of the extreme right in this House.
Chirac speaks of the rights of the Inuits in Quebec, but ignores linguistic rights in France.
You can morally condemn this but, politically speaking, you should consider that, in its literal meaning, xenophobia is the source of all the national liberation movements which we have praised at other times.
The right to enter, live and die in your own country are fundamental, sacrosanct rights and I hope that this Parliament will uphold them.
Thanks to our discussions, I have gained a much deeper insight into the complexity of the matter and I would especially praise him here in public for his openness.
People from these groups, more often than not economically vulnerable, run the considerable risk of becoming victims of discrimination.
Mr President, there are still many people, some of which are in this House if this debate is anything to go by, who would like to give preferential treatment to marriage and family and, as such, openly insult and discriminate against anyone making a different choice in their private lives.
Just one more example: last Sunday the Basque people received an intimidating invitation not to turn out to vote.
Mrs Palacio, who is just leaving, has said that human rights are needed in a public place and at the core.
Mr President, what has not been stressed sufficiently thus far in the debate I believe is democracy and subsidiarity.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
In terms of chocolate, as in other areas, different cultures and traditions exist.
With regard to food policy and consumer protection, we must be very careful.
Will we now harmonise the composition of tomato ketchup, mustard, cooked meats, cheese, beer or pizzas, all in the name of a single market aiming to promote a single taste solely for the benefit of the food business?
You could almost imagine yourself faced with a bar of chocolate!
It means protecting the natural environment on the ground too.
This is why I am now fighting for measures to be adopted in order to guarantee that emission standards for hazardous waste will not be diluted.
These use hazardous waste as fuel for the production of energy or physical elements.
It is therefore vital that these by-products are monitored and prevented from escaping into the environment.
The sensible measures put forward by the Commission should encourage the utilisation of this technology.
The sorting of waste which they carry out therefore appears to be useless.
I feel this is a good compromise.
Secondly, the Ludford report has a series of amendments tabled by the Christian Democrats challenging a series of paragraphs that were originally in the Evregenis report 15 years ago - and were approved by the Christian Democrats then - on the amendment of the Staff Regulations to allow ethnic minority members to join the European Community staff.
Secondly, we are against all the points which fly in the face of the basic principle of solidarity.
Mr Haarder goes much further in his assault, for he tries indirectly to strengthen those unions which do not recognise precisely those collective victories which have helped create the welfare and the human rights which we have spent all day debating.
I will therefore present Mr Hernández Mollar' s intervention.
Not only the European Commission but also this Parliament would do well to pay a lot more attention to this.
We must overcome this and incite our governments to be European through and through.
The European Union is something much greater than that; it has a common origin and a dream which we must fight to realise, and civil rights are an integral part of that fight.
I hope that this institution will not only be supported and will attract a great deal of publicity and attention on the day of its inauguration, but that Parliament, the Council and the Commission will actively support it in years to come.
There are naturally some controversial issues in this area, and people may see things in various different lights in different areas.
And although we may all say that we oppose xenophobia, I am not sure if we can all agree on active steps to integrate foreign citizens into the European Union and accept measures to protect the interests of foreign citizens within the European Union.
We shall see whether, in the course of the Intergovernmental Conference, we can achieve a consensus that will allow us to make further progress on this matter.
I think the first annual report of this new European Parliament is thorough and timely.
The second element, our cooperation programmes, include the PHARE national programmes, PHARE Democracy and the MEDA Programme.
We have also proposed making the very important Brussels Convention of 1968 on Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of Judgements in Civil and Commercial Matters into a regulation.
Even the United Kingdom and Ireland have decided to join the Member States on this and Denmark, which does not have the same capacity to participate in work on civil legal cooperation, is also seeking solutions which are currently being examined.
Mr President, we are beginning to establish a common asylum and immigration law in Europe.
In all events, the European Parliament is calling for the right to exercise parliamentary scrutiny, in which case the Council and the Commission will have the final word on the matter.
The joint debate is closed.
In the case of the pig sector the export trade is also suffering because during the past two years the pig industry has experienced acute difficulties.
This is a case of negligence on the part of the Member States in putting these matters and the system into effect.
We need to eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy while, at the same time, providing total traceability with regard to livestock movement as well as safeguarding public health.
With a cattle population in Ireland of between 7 and 8 million in recent years, some 10.5 million TB tests have been undertaken annually in some 138 000 herds.
I should also like to point out in this connection that, rather than planting more trees, we need to clear the jungle of paragraphs and exemptions.
I regret I cannot make it any clearer and I regret I cannot accede to your request: I would ask you again, in the light of what I have said about making myself available to your committee, to discuss the interaction between 152 and 37, and to give serious consideration to withdrawing this amendment yourself.
We believe that the work that has been done, and the increasing awareness on the part of the candidate countries of the need to work with the European Union during the pre-accession period to strengthen control mechanisms, combined with collaboration in this field, may yield concrete results.
When it comes to the development of the Treaty of Amsterdam, I think it is important for us to bear in mind that transfers of power have taken place, and that further transfers of power remain to be made over the next five years from what was the old third pillar to the first pillar of the Union, particularly as regards visas, judicial cooperation in civil matters and customs cooperation.
During an earlier debate I said that we are now all Austrians within the European Union, and I would like to repeat that.
In your reply to Mr Dupuis' question, you referred to the fact that the sanctions approved by the Heads of State and Governments of fourteen countries were bilateral in nature.
Given that the embargo is continuing, as is the harsh winter, does the Council intend to take steps to extend the 'Energy for Democracy' programme as quickly as possible and to cover the needs of hospitals and schools?
Has it attempted to obtain this information and, if so, will it forward it to the author of this question and to the European Parliament?
Turning to your questions about the nuclear power stations in Ukraine, whose names I find rather difficult to read - Khmelnitsky and Rivne - may I remind you that is it for the Commission to carry out technical assessments of these nuclear power stations so as to determine what maintenance is required, or even closure.
80 to 90% of the films showing in Sweden are, however, American.
What we have to recognise is that when we are considering a broader Community, no situation affecting democratic rights in one country can be a matter of indifference to the other countries and their citizens.
Up until now, it is only opinions you are punishing and not actions.
However, Mr Bonde, you should not, of course, confuse economic and monetary union with Nazism, they are in fact slightly different.
I just wondered if you could give us examples of other similar organisations in government that make these decisions in the same way.
This is a trade agreement which falls within the competence of the EU and, as you rightly say, we only have the option of saying yes or no.
For the rest, I should like to say to Mr Folias, who worries about the problem of footwear that, generally-speaking, trade relations between Europe and Mexico have always proven their worth in the past.
Coming as I do from the Canary Islands, a region located to the north-east of the continent of Africa, with my political soul divided between Europe and America, I am delighted to witness this debate on Mrs Ferrer' s report. The opinion Parliament is expressing on the association agreement is not just about its trading aspects, but also about its political implications as we experience the extraordinary scenario of globalisation.
Today we have analysed the contract and found that the agreement with the EU not only creates the same sort of relationship as with NAFTA, but that, in parts, it is even worse.
The most serious violations include the systematic use of torture, illegal arrests, disappearances, executions by paramilitary death squads, the arrest of trade unionists, bans on strikes and allegations of enforced sterilisation in the State of Guererro.
All this is common knowledge and I need say no more.
EC operators will be very rapidly able to compete on the Mexican market on an equal footing with industries elsewhere, notably the United States.
When I was a young child, a library was opened in a village where I was born and brought up; when the head teacher of the village school opened the library, he said that there were over 4 000 books in the library, and I thought with all the wisdom of a six-year old child: well, that is all the books in the world.
Mr President, Commissioner Liikanen, the e-Europe initiative by the European Commission is to be welcomed in principle.
Scandinavia is acquitting itself well with its social infrastructure and also, perhaps, with its pensions systems.
We should also remember that the EU countries are very different from one another and that developments are very rapid.
Nonetheless, we should also support the OECD in its work.
How can these two things be reconciled?
It offers more power, more choice, lower prices to citizens across Europe and indeed across the world, and in my view the best thing that governments can do in cyberspace is to stay out of it as much as they possibly can and let consumers, businesses and citizens get on with their businesses and their lives.
I would therefore like to congratulate the Portuguese presidency on its decision to make this issue the focus of the special summit.
The Commission is currently contributing to the preparation of next week's summit in Lisbon.
These actions will result in increasing numbers of jobs and will thereby reduce the principal cause of social exclusion, namely unemployment.
But when it has been set on the agenda at the beginning of the week I am not clear that Members can move deferral.
Maybe it would be better to stop at the comma, after "physical and psychological abuse and all kinds of discrimination" .
It is the English version which is correct.
Mr President, I think the translation of Mr Speroni' s speech may not have been entirely correct. He appeared to me to be saying the complete opposite regarding the decision taken.
That is why I cannot take it now.
In any case, whatever its final form, the national parliaments should not have been sidelined.
This way of thinking is fundamentally different from our own vision of a European Community.
We need more time and debate on these potential conflicts.
- (SV) At the Council' s meeting in Cologne, it was decided that an EU Charter of Fundamental Rights should be prepared.
I would much rather see the European Union and, of course, all the Member States, quickly accede to the 1950 Human Rights Convention as opposed to the inevitable dispute regarding the new wording of the fundamental rights of Union citizens.
In order to safeguard uniform case law and prevent differing interpretations, case law should continue to be the preserve of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg which, thanks to the quality of its case law on the 1950 Convention over the past 40 years, has provided a dynamic instrument which takes full account of the social, economic and ethical developments within our society.
We need to be wary of perhaps well-meant, generous proposals if we want to prevent decision processes in the EU being crippled by a plethora of recourse proceedings which would mean more than doubling the number of judges at the European Court of Justice, and nobody would know where to enforce their basic rights any more or how long they must wait for a judgement.
Members of the Environment Committee clearly cannot be aware of the undue delays that any non-approval of Structural Funds programmes would create, nor indeed of the new budgetary procedure that could involve not only delays but the loss of millions in funds in the case of the UK to Merseyside, South Yorkshire, the Highlands and Islands, Northern Ireland, Cornwall and the Isle of Wight.
This clause does not change the fundamental nature of these agreements but does enable both parties to reaffirm respect for certain common values and principles as the precondition for any form of cooperation, economic or other.
Moreover, the intelligence operations of third countries, including the United States, operating in cooperation with British intelligence services within the United Kingdom, are also subject to the same democratic oversight.
On the situation of candidate countries, much progress remains to be made, especially in relation to respect for the rights of minorities.
This section is poorly drafted and ambiguous.
It calls for equal rights for same-sex couples and traditional couples and families, forgetting the vital role the family plays in social cohesion.
"We fully subscribe to the international agreements to protect minorities and minority languages.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
Western Sahara
B5-0278/2000 by Mr Salafranca Sánchez Neyra and others on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats
It must carry out that role by, amongst other things, supporting the decisions of the United Nations and ensuring that the process reaches a conclusion in total transparency and with maximum guarantees, complete probity and respect for democracy.
I have heard that the international community has put one hundred million on the table in the meantime, and that the EU has made a disproportionate contribution to this.
Concerning coordination with other donors and aid agencies: the Mozambique government, in conjunction with the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance (OCHA), provides the principal platform for coordination of rescue and relief as expressed in the consolidated appeals they have made.
Presidential elections in Peru:
Naturally, we must condemn infringements on both sides, but we should not confuse the perpetrator of genocide with his victims and that means that we must take good care not only to provide humanitarian aid - that must be done and it is high time that something was done by the EU here - but also to ensure that a political solution is found to the conflict.
Alternative reports can be directly provided via stations in Croatia and also in Montenegro.
That is why our resolution calls for this embargo to be lifted.
According to the UN humanitarian agencies, several hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, including some 500 000 children, have died prematurely because of the embargo, for lack of food, medicines or adequate care.
With every passing moment, we are rushing towards the danger of a military clash which must be avoided.
We want to make that message as loud and clear and unequivocal as we possibly can.
Dennis Halliday, who resigned from his position as director of the UN humanitarian mission in Iraq in protest at the sanctions, confirms the UNICEF statistics - five to six thousand children die every month as a direct result of the sanctions.
The United Nations and, without doubt, the United States of America find themselves in this position.
It is long overdue, for the reasons which our previous speakers have already underlined.
They are also supporting the mission of observers of the Organisation of American States, led by the former Minister for Foreign Affairs of Guatemala, Mr Eduardo Stein.
Combatting organised crime
We need a pan-European system of internal security, and here the Balkans are naturally a special cause for concern because we have assumed responsibility in Kosovo and the neighbouring regions.
The debate is closed.
B5-0243/2000 by Mrs Maij-Weggen and Mr Bowis, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES);
B5-0260/2000 by Mr Davies and others, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES);
In addition, this minke whale is an endangered species and it would be preferable to keep to the arrangement to protect all whales.
Shooting elephants in order to sell their tusks to Japan and then giving the proceeds away - at least on paper - to protect wild animals is a perverse kind of logic.
If I may briefly explain, we withdrew them because we shall be holding a longer, more detailed debate on this subject during the next Strasbourg session.
Amendments 53 and 55 called for the term "ethnic" to be deleted.
(Parliament approved the motion for a resolution)
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is the first explanation of vote which I have given in many years and my first explanation of vote as chairman of the EPP-ED Group.
Let me take this opportunity to repeat that we must keep up the pressure on the Austrian Government and continue to encourage public debate.
This requires a careful mixture, firstly of education, and only when absolutely necessary, of legislation.
At the same time, we do not think the states that already belong to the European Union are in a position to teach lessons to countries that are only at the stage of applying for accession, given the extent to which the ignominy of racism and xenophobia is being propagated in most of the Member States of the European Union itself, by demagogues from the extreme right, even and including some within this Parliament.
According to Article 3 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks, owning and managing official foreign reserve assets is one of the tasks of the ECB.
We, the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the entire Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, as the rapporteur has already said, welcome this proposal.
Can I go ahead?
The next item is the report (A5-0046/2000) by Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation on information measures relating to the common agricultural policy (COM(1999) 536 - C5-0249/1999 - 1999/0209(CNS)).
It is, therefore, also important to make it clear that the subsidy arrangements ensure that consumers obtain food at prices which, as a result of the subsidy, are lower than they would be without the subsidy.
Furthermore, we know that the draft guide to the rules makes access to the budgetary line I have just mentioned even more difficult for organisations, especially those in a weaker financial position, in other words, exactly the ones that need the most support.
The purpose of this change is only to legally endorse what has become common practice on the committees.
The next item is the debate on the following oral questions to the Commission:
Therefore central government expenditure is reduced.
Commissioner: three questions:
Or is it all just the usual Labour/Liberal coalition hot air, all mouth, while feet drag along the cobbled streets of Edinburgh and European money is hijacked by the Treasury in London?
It may be worse yet.
We share Mr Galeote Quecedo' s disapproval of the displays of politically motivated violence in the Basque country.
This is probably the most important element in this amended set of provisions.
Then, of course, the systems have to be put in place in Member States to enable this to happen, so that the dates that I have put on this are, as it were, a conservative estimate.
I am convinced that, with regard to the consumer, we would be taken more seriously by producers if we were also to do away with the slaughter of animals at risk and if we were to have the same legislation throughout the entire Community.
We look forward to what the Commissioner has to say, and I have to underline that it is very important that she should satisfy the Environment Committee and the Parliament, not least because if she is asking us to suspend the application of any part of the regulation, it will have to come through this Parliament by codecision.
thirdly, we consider that the position of the United States, calling for withdrawal of the regulation or indefinite suspension of its implementation, is totally unacceptable;
That is all we know for sure.
That is something which many of us here wish to bear in mind, which is why we tabled this legislation.
Now, I feel that the issue here is not which devices should be used in aircraft to reduce noise, for standardised procedures exist to control the levels of aircraft noise, but that the important thing is for the noise limits not to be exceeded.
Morgantini, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, to the Council (B5-0204/2000);
Queiró, Muscardini, on behalf of the UEN Group, to the Council (B5-0210/2000);
Economic cooperation must include multilateral/bilateral approaches facilitating the promotion of trade among Mediterranean countries and south-south trade.
This is no need to remind you of the important common interests we have with those countries in terms of agriculture and fishing, nor the serious shared problems relating to immigration between Andalusia and Morocco, which create added difficulties.
The economic objective of the partnership is to create an area of shared prosperity through the progressive establishment of free trade accompanied by substantial EU financial support for economic transition and to help the partners confront the social and economic challenges which this implies.
On the other hand, there is no certainty whatsoever when it comes to the future of the Mediterranean.
Let me take Tunisia as an example, one of the first countries with which we signed a partnership agreement.
The situation of the rule of law and human rights in this country is scandalous.
There is no salvation to be found here, except by a proactive approach which - let me say quite bluntly - involve our regarding transatlantic communities of interest or relations with the continent of Asia as secondary and focusing on privileged relations, 'privileged' in the precise meaning of the word, with the Arab world.
It would be impossible to summarise the Minister' s answer in five lines, because he referred to all the issues but did not answer the key questions.
Secondly, in my opinion, there is a lack of generosity.
As a result, we have been asked to ensure that the Union has a greater political involvement in the Mediterranean.
I would like to take this opportunity to tell you that the Secretary of State has formally apologised for being unable to remain with us for the continuation of the debate.
We are uneasy because we do not understand very well where this High Level Working Group comes from or why it is being maintained, why the Council is making a proposal in this way and why that proposal was taken up at Tampere; what the Commission is going to do in these action plans and what coherence there is between this proposal and the work carried out by the Council' s High Level Working Group and the rest of the Commission proposals on policies to be implemented in the Union.
Let us look at the situation in Iraq.
The European Parliament was consulted on neither the appointments to the group nor the crisis regions selected.
No one would deny that this is an area where countries can gain from mutual collaboration but, of course, there is nothing new about cooperation among our home countries in the asylum field.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report highlights the many errors and omissions which the action plans contain.
A high-level action plan, Mr President, that does not recognise these fundamental reports is - I would argue - not worth the paper it is written on.
We are dealing with 15 Member States which have their own national resources and, as a legislator with equal rights, Parliament must naturally make use of its opportunities here.
There are many areas that call for financing, but there are only a few vital ones.
Farmers and cooperatives expect the European Commission to reduce the amount of red tape in the agricultural economy and adopt budgetary guidelines based on calculation, reliability and progressive structures.
However, I need to remind the Council - and at least we have one willing scribe down there if no one else is doing the night shift for the Council to get the message across - that really, if the Commission makes the proposal which we expect them to make, then they are duty bound, because of the interinstitutional agreement, to discuss with Parliament what that revision should be before their first reading.
Mr President, it takes some nerve to state that employment is, and I quote, a constant priority of the European institutions at a time when the European Union has 18 million unemployed and when, at this very moment, a number of the most wealthy of all major European businesses are announcing savage job cuts without the said institutions lifting a finger to prevent them.
This is a very serious commitment.
Above all, the report expresses support for the Commission' s administrative reform and I should expressly like to thank the rapporteur for that.
You demanded this of the Commission and the Council in your resolution of 16 December.
I should like to note, on the question of the financial perspective, that the Commission proposes, following the European Parliament' s petition and demand, to include expenditure for promoting Cyprus and Malta under enlargement expenditure in the future, i.e. under the heading of Category 7.
I should perhaps come back to the budgetary procedure for the budgetary year 2000.
It is our duty to implement this with all the means at our disposal.
All the major players in the Swedish tourist industry have already promised to comply with a special code of conduct.
These clients, from Europe, the United States or Japan are the hard core of child abusers.
We might remember the old Japanese proverb which says, 'The traveller knows no shame' .
There must be criminal penalties for child abusers.
This assessment may provide the opportunity to focus on suppressing child sex tourism, and to draw up an initial status report.
There, however, it is a kind of forensic lottery, as academics have called it, because many people who are injured get nothing at all and some people who are injured get enormous damages.
That is a good way of finding out if there are alarming and urgent matters needing swift action.
At the same time, liability is statute barred after ten years and capped at EUR 75 million.
If our regulations on product liability stifle competitiveness and innovation, I suggest that consumers will be at a major disadvantage as well.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
The next item is the report (A5-0078/2000) by Mr Turmes, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on electricity from renewable sources and the internal electricity market (SEC(1999)0470 - C5-0342/1999 - 2000/2002(COS)).
The reasons for this are energy prices which do not incorporate the external costs, with the sizeable subsidies which are still available to the nuclear sector as well as the fossil-fuel sector.
Fifthly, more and more studies are implying that actual sources of fossil fuels are much smaller than we perceive them to be today.
More importantly, I cannot agree when there is talk of the curse of the lowest bidder.
The directive should also contain mechanisms to discourage, as we have already heard, the Member States from their market distorting subsidies to traditional forms of energy, particularly fossil fuels and nuclear.
Mr President, the need to promote the development of sources of renewable energy becomes a crucial matter every time that issues such as the Kyoto protocol and meeting our commitments to reducing greenhouse gas emissions are raised or when we talk about sustainability in energy policy.
More proactive planning guidance, preferably linked to regional renewable targets, and feasibility studies would be helpful additions to the directive.
I think we must consider all matters related to renewable energies to be extremely important, bearing in mind the fact that we want to leave behind us a world which future generations will find inhabitable.
We all agree that renewable energies have to play a key role in guaranteeing our supply of energy, as well as making us less dependent on imports and in fulfilling the commitments we gave in Kyoto.
Anyway, Mr Vander Taelen admitted he did not personally witness the incident.
This interception, which must be in proportion and have clearly defined limits, must pursue specific aims such as combating organised crime.
However, we are aware of the concerns about the negative aspects, which the proliferation of encryption services for confidentiality purposes may have in the fight against certain forms of crime.
Madam President, I have issued this statement on behalf of Mr von Boetticher who, because of a bereavement, had to travel back to Germany yesterday.
Do we want a non-permanent committee?
Do we want an own-initiative report? Do we want to take other measures in order to shed more light on the outstanding issues, to obtain more answers and, above all, to examine whether Community law has been broken?
I can only answer the Member' s second question in writing, as I do not have precise information on this.
The last issue I should like to deal with is the matter of the Community patent.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
If Parliament is serious about enlargement eastwards, efforts must be made to cut back considerably on the costs of agriculture.
Why do we forget France' s responsibility for the war it waged in Algeria and for the tragic situation that still exists in that country today?
The European Union must consider the island regions of the Mediterranean, particularly in terms of fisheries and agriculture.
We are hoping for synergy in the coordination of the interregional and transnational cooperation programmes, and for coordination between the Interreg and MEDA programmes.
We must go even further and establish measures such as a coherent child protection policy by creating a new general legal base in the context of the next revision of the Treaty, with adequate Community funding.
We must not be blind to the fact that the Internet facilitates these 'practices' .
Consequently, all the European Union and Member State institutions must be inspired in their action by the protection of children' s rights as recognised in the United Nations Convention of 20 November 1989.
How else could we, as parents, especially mothers, and elected representatives, doubly responsible for the continuity of our societies, regard these acts, all the more heinous because they are committed against the weakest of all?
At present, it seems that animals have more rights than children in Europe.
Mr President, I voted for the MacCormick report on liability for defective products because 'it is meet and right so to do' .
However, I have taken the floor to explain my reasons for voting in this way because I wish to say that, once again, there is something missing.
Nowadays, it is impossible to live without electricity.
The University of Edinburgh' s application for this patent has nothing to do with cloning (cloning was considered impossible when the patent was filed!)
It is established and legitimate practice in both academic and biopharmaceutical research to genetically manipulate human cells in tissue culture.
As elected representatives and citizens, we are outpaced by issues where the scientific component is too strong.
In other parliaments ushers are treated with the respect that they deserve.
(Applause from the left)
This is something about which we wanted to give you plenty of notice, so as to enable you, by being either present or absent, and not just by what you affirm, to make it known what you want on Fridays: to make the agenda more substantial or abolish it.
Agenda
We of course regret this, but the fact remains.
Child pornography on the Internet
That is the reason for my report - to protect children, to try and help children to avoid being abused in this particular manner.
Who are these children and what is being done to locate them?
It is not the Internet itself which is to blame, but the child pornographers, and they must be punished severely.
The Council and Parliament adopted it on 25 January 1999.
On behalf of my Group, I wish this new type of Structural Fund, because this is what it comes down to, every success. I also want to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Frahm, on the handling of this important topic and I hope that she will accept my efforts in the field of tailor-made solutions for what they mean as regards, on the one hand, refugees and, on the other, displaced persons.
Only in this way can routine long-term measures also be maintained.
It is, therefore, also a good thing that the EU should be able to come up with aid in support of large influxes of refugees.
Very few resources are allocated to the Fund, considering the scale of its activities - improving reception conditions, integrating persons benefiting from international protection, encouraging voluntary return by facilitating reintegration in the country of origin.
You cannot, in the case of displaced persons whose main concern is to return to their homeland, require that the host country integrate them into the labour market.
There is, of course, the standard definition of refugee given in the 1951 Geneva Convention, but obviously all sorts of categories of displaced person can be added to the list, including persons accepted into the country in accordance not with international commitments but only with national legislation, decisions or practice.
Implementation, monitoring, follow-up and assessment arrangements are based on the existing conditions for Structural Funds.
The debate is closed.
For example, the waiver could be used for university campus payment cards or for local transport systems.
The sooner the directive is adopted and implemented, the sooner the improved regulation will take effect.
Let me ask all comrades and colleagues around this room today to consider the effects of the amendments that could be passed this week, the damage they could cause, the lack of confidence that would surely emerge and the damage it would do to this nascent market.
It means that money is paid into an institution and received in another form, but it is the same amount of money.
If these two directives fail it will be detrimental to European consumers, businesses and the whole e-commerce initiative.
I will have to put my technical hat on for a moment and mention the tangle of comitology legislation because, since the Commission proposal has been submitted, comitology legislation has been changed and, from now on, Council Decision 1999/468 applies.
If crises were to have a purifying effect, then Agriculture Ministers would have rather more understanding than they evidently do.
The rapporteur, and also Mrs Klaß, who has just spoken, have pointed out that Parliament allowed the Commission proposal to pass through first reading unamended.
Has it learnt that it is better to be transparent?
It has submitted to us a common position in which the option to have a safeguard clause will actually be taken away from the Commission.
It is better to leave things in the hands of the Agriculture Ministers.
In the context of the forthcoming establishment of the European health authority, it would therefore be advisable to allocate this body real resources in order to enable fast detection and thus prevent contagion.
I particularly appreciate the good collaboration with Parliament in this case.
A survey of the current situation shows that 307 additives are authorised within the European Union.
That makes 307 authorised additives, only 163 of which may be considered as totally harmless, indicating that many others are either suspect or actually cause food safety-related problems.
What is being proposed today?
It is common knowledge today that the precautionary principle was practically unheard of seven or eight years ago, whereas today it has come to the fore.
We must consequently reject this one too.
I think the situation is unacceptable in this area, but I do not see the investigation having made any impression upon the Commission.
Current liberalisation of the quantity of permitted additives is worrying.
Not approving ethylhydroxyethylcellulose makes life more difficult for people with gluten intolerance and for families with gluten intolerant children.
He has done a service to the committee and also to this House by pointing out that this procedure appears to be almost always one-way.
Next, there is one other aspect which has not been taken into account, to wit, the potential interaction between the many additives found in food.
Could the EPP Group please get its act together!
Amendments must either be tabled in the name of 32 Members or in the name of a political group and actually represent the position of that political group, not of the individual who happens to table them in the name of the group so as to circumvent the limitation on tabling rules in plenary.
We can leave this until next month.
But it is responsible for dealing with this legacy and it will only distinguish itself positively from its predecessors if it takes a ruthless approach and clears up every last one of these cases.
I am not in favour - and I say so quite clearly, despite all the difficulties which we have to overcome - of sending yet another box of chocolates over to the Council in its building and tying yet another ribbon around it and saying, all right, we profess our faith in the fact that the whole procedure is beset with legal problems.
We are prepared to grant discharge under these conditions.
Further to the agreement we concluded with the Committee on Budgetary Control, I also expect that the action plan on 15 May will help us at the Parliament to turn a corner, in tandem with the Commission.
I should like once again to extend my thanks on behalf of the Commission, especially to the rapporteur at the time, Mrs van der Laan and, in this context, to the rapporteur for the reforms, Mr van Hulten.
This is why the Commission has started reforming financial management as a whole by increasing the responsibility of everyone who handles the money of the European taxpayers, by improving efficiency and by setting the clear objective of restoring trust in the European institutions.
On the contrary, what is needed is a thorough examination on the basis of pertinent sources of information and a conscientious appraisal of the results.
Other cases should be on the list, but the Commission has unfortunately not yet passed them on, despite the date of March 2000 set in the 1997 discharge.
Mr Kuhne has done an excellent job as rapporteur for the Parliament discharge.
It has still not been published officially, and therefore it is difficult for us to comment on it.
Thank you, Mr President, for all your kind support over the years for the Budgetary Control Committee.
Mr President, I would like to echo what some speakers have already expressed before me: after last year' s events, this Commission will need to have all its wits about it if it intends to ignore what this Parliament has to say in resolutions.
Thirdly, where does the Commissioners' responsibility lie?
On the contrary, we had no party political axes to grind in our committee and we obtained a broadly-carried compromise across all groups with just one vote against.
It should not be any surprise to outside observers, or those in the system, that as Parliament has become more authoritative in ensuring the democratic accountability of the institutions, it will not be simply fobbed off with a lack of reply to questions which have been asked, however far they go back into the past.
The first is access to information.
The Kuhne report is Parliament' s first report which takes discharge seriously.
This House would lose face and would discredit itself in the eyes of public opinion in our countries, and that is something we do not want.
In its 1998 annual report, the Court of Auditors mentioned an unacceptably high error rate and felt compelled, would you believe, to issue a negative Statement of Assurance.
The Secretary-General has mentioned a few procedural reasons, but is this the full story?
Rapporteur Kuhne also puts his finger on the problems regarding the financing of the Spinelli building.
This is a quality issue which will also have to be increasingly discussed in the context of this debate.
There are still unresolved demands but, if we postpone granting the discharge, this will be accompanied by clear demands upon the Commission.
There is the old case of visiting scientist B and how his contract came into being.
Mr President, as the Commission is well aware, I am not accustomed to being an easy-going, meek or lenient speaker when it comes to the Commission in its role as executive.
We are having problems and we are having problems in finding out who is the right person; the people we talk to are not clear what their responsibility is, what information they should be giving us.
I should explain to the House that the reason we do this is so that all the groups can prepare their voting slips and so that there is no confusion during the votes.
Lannoye report (A5-0072/2000):
So, in order to justify the inclusion of an additive in a foodstuff, there are three criteria which must be fulfilled, though there is still rather a wide margin for interpretation.
With regard to the information society, the principle elements of the e-Europe initiative proposed by the Commission were put into effect, in particular regarding the legal framework for e-commerce, the opening of the telecommunications market, internet connections for schools and teacher training.
With regard to the internal market, the European Council adopted ambitious objectives in the field of procurement and in order to implement action plans for financial services and risk capital.
Secondly, we must reduce the tax burden among the workforce, especially among the relatively low paid and less educated.
The connection must be made between the dissemination of modern communication techniques and the implementation of sustainable development.
The same applies to the matter of taxation, which you mentioned.
Judge the Austrian government by its deeds.
(Applause from the right)
I stress the word "potential" because, as others have said, we now need to look at the follow-up.
Partly that follow-up is institutional.
What proposals, for example, will the Commission come forward with by June this year on social inclusion, as it was challenged to do in the Lisbon conclusions?
We have to tackle that reform of the Treaty.
The first sure indication of its success and of its historic importance was the level of representation of European and African countries: 58 countries - 45 from Africa and 13 from Europe - were represented at Head of State or Government level.
This is important to note in view also of the very few statements made during the summit that deviated somewhat from this general consensus about the basic principles that we and others take for granted.
The top priority of regional cooperation and integration should have strong political benefits as well as trade ones.
We expect the African countries to observe cease-fires, but we are fanning the flames of conflict with our arms exports to belligerents.
All the more reason not to flood Africa with the unregulated world economy and not to flood Europe with an influx of people.
If the agreements are not forthcoming, then a good atmosphere is neither here nor there.
We need to support what works but we also need to dare to speak up if certain things are unsuitable.
There was also satisfaction with regard to some of the tangible results of the conference in areas such as the cancellation of debt, the elimination of anti-personnel mines and the return of cultural goods pillaged by colonial powers.
Thus, that world order will have to be more egalitarian, shared, cohesive, democratic and compatible with the values which we in the European Union proclaim as our distinguishing marks.
Civil society has a key role to play in Africa' s development process.
.
It suggests that we need greater coherence in what we are doing and I am looking forward to hearing the views of Members of Parliament on the document, which I hope they will regard as an important and useful contribution to a debate which is going to become more important, not less important, over the coming years.
It is true that the President of the Commission, my colleagues Pascal Lamy and Poul Nielson and myself were all confronted during that summit with a litany of complaints about the slow delivery of European Union assistance.
We must also be able to combine different tools more effectively and flexibly into a tailor-made mix to suit the particular situation.
I have dealt with that point earlier in my remarks.
My own favourite economist and guru, Jane Jacobs, points out that everything is disappointing in practice.
Mr President, I would first of all like to extend warm thanks to Commissioner Patten for his extensive clarification.
I have always noticed that it is the Carter Institute which is responsible for election observation over there, and it always acquits itself of this task in a very professional and very transparent manner.
We want to ensure that what the Union does is more recognisable: it is not just a question of logos or armbands but of the whole presentation of what we are doing.
What sort of timetable should we be working towards?
Maybe we should learn something from that, though I agree that there are some important high-level retired politicians whom one would not want to see necessarily supervising elections. At which point discretion is the better part of valour.
The High Representative and his colleagues in the secretariat are bending their best efforts to try to achieve that at the moment.
It is much needed.
For example, you can distinguish very well between the humanitarian assistance which ECHO has given in Serbia and the assistance we have given through the Energy through Democracy programme.
Where was ECHO?
Can the Commission explain the reasons for this non-participation?
Will the Commission insist on its right to participate?
No applications have been filed.
Allow me to tell you what we can do within the framework of accession negotiations.
But I think that it is our common responsibility to find an answer, including a financial answer, as far as the important obligation that the European Union has in south-eastern Europe is concerned.
As far as Mr van Buitenen is concerned, he took up employment on 1 April in the Directorate-General for Health and Consumer Protection in Luxembourg in a very responsible job, as the House would expect.
We had group meetings; I was watching the screen and you jumped from Question 41 to 49.
Hence the importance of holding the screening procedure that is being prepared and the importance of Turkey' s commitment to incorporating the body of Community legislation and also to respecting the Copenhagen criteria.
At last, it is again possible to discuss all issues openly and critically.
I should, however, like to say a few more words about the political situation in Turkey.
It is difficult to discern any further democratic developments during these first four months.
They certainly want membership.
Then you have a third group, who say that they want Turkey to become a member, but on Turkish terms.
Akin Birdal, who held talks with Mr Barón Crespo, was taken into prison while he was standing outside.
The Turks tell us they need time, they need a great deal of time, because this reform can only be achieved one step at a time.
Even the fact that the head of government, Mr Ecevit, described Kurdish as a dialect of Turkish, despite the fact that the two languages have fundamentally different roots, is an indication of the hardening of the political situation in Turkey.
I experienced surprise after surprise and also disappointment after disappointment.
Furthermore, the very fact that we are currently making good progress with the planned enlargement of the Union to include Central and Eastern Europe enables us to prove that Turkey is not being discriminated against.
Criticism must be levelled at the Turks, not in order to prevent them from continuing in this process, but we must monitor the situation closely so that they can implement the changes necessary for this process to continue successfully.
I want to see that European Commission proposals have real teeth when it comes to this Parliament in the not too distant future.
We must also address an issue which was avoided at first reading, and that is the question of the control of the import and export of GMO crops and other GMO products.
They have supported us in continuing to press the Council of Ministers to agree on new GMO rules on licensing as quickly as possible, to bring to an end the de facto moratorium on new GMO commercial approvals, which has been in operation since the Commission published its proposal almost two years ago.
The lobbying has become quite intense in the last few weeks.
He really has tried to find compromises on this complicated issue but has not succeeded in finding compromises in all areas which all the Groups here in the House are able to support, which is why we shall be voting on one or two points tomorrow.
Both in the main body of the Directive itself, notably in Article 1, and in its application, the precautionary principle has been accorded an important role when it comes to weighing it up against economic interests.
Hence, it is essential that we introduce a modern framework governing the development, marketing and exploitation of genetically-modified organisms.
It is also important for provision to be made for the directive to be adjusted and amended in line with new developments resulting from the fast pace of change in biotechnology and its applications.
We are already lagging far behind other countries.
No one wants to play down genetic engineering, including me.
Mr President, when I started at the Commission last autumn I realised very quickly that the directive on the deliberate release of GMOs would be one of the most sensitive dossiers under my responsibility.
The Commission cannot agree to a general ban of GMOs containing antibiotic resistance marker genes.
The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 21 since the legal basis of future legislative measures is subject to its content and cannot be established in advance by this directive.
However, I should like to stress that careful evaluation of a centralised procedure would be done in the Commission report required under Article 30 of the directive.
That has to be discussed in depth and I will come back with a proposal.
And secondly, some amendments deal with how permits are to be granted to enterprises, operators and so on to apply the labels, to label the meat.
The postponement adopted is not lawful.
The purpose of the regulation in question must be to achieve a situation in which consumers have confidence in meat from all EU countries.
Consideration must be given to the pasturing lists which are already in use and which take account of this situation in order to avoid forcing additional unnecessary administrative costs on farmers.
Generally speaking, I am delighted that at last we are going to have clear labelling and, as I said, I want it to be the country and region of origin.
First to ensure the traceability of beef, second to allow consumers to make a fully informed choice.
For this reason, whatever the final form of Article 13, I regard Amendments Nos 15 and 29 as being of the first importance.
That concludes the debate.
But it is very difficult for Members to sit right through every single question during Question Time just in case we jump from No 1 to No 99 in a matter of seconds.
It is so embarrassing.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, however much I respect the opinion of the Members who have just spoken, I find it harsh and unjust to regard our report as inadmissible because of paragraph 15.
The UEN Group are welcome to vote against them and then we will see if it is left in or taken out.
(Laughter and applause)
But in order to bring the report of the Committee on Legal Affairs as far as possible into line with the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, I tabled four more amendments in the plenary meeting.
This is where I would like to conclude my brief report on a not unimportant contribution to what will probably be the last IGC before the largest, most historic and most risky enlargement since the inception of the present European integration process.
We should simplify it while respecting the existing balances of power.
We must bear that in mind tomorrow, when we come to vote on the amendments and the text.
The Group is divided over double majority, closer cooperation, the number of Commissioners and security policy.
We cannot create an Amsterdam 2.
We have support across the political spectrum from communists to conservatives. We disagree about a lot but agree that our differences should be resolved in democratic parliaments.
We would like to make three points.
The EU' s major problem today is not a lack of centralised power but a shortage of real democracy.
I share the minority view of Mr Berthu, a member of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group, as it has been included in this report.
President, Commissioner, we are faced with a fundamental difficulty, in the exercise in which we are involved, in maintaining the balance between enlarging the EU and reforming the institutions to make that enlargement possible.
If the EU delays enlargement too long, it may make it more difficult, or impossible, for some candidate countries to join within the envisaged timetable.
(The President declared the common position approved)
I have the Council' s common position of 9 December 1999 before me.
(The President declared the common position approved as amended)
Mr President, of course, it is important, if not essential, for the European Union to be engaged in statistics.
Mr President, I voted for this resolution because, clearly, the transport of dangerous goods is constantly in need of regulation.
We must adopt an immediate and categorical ban on the use of antibiotic resistant genes.
The proposals of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy set out a strict and transparent framework, thus responding fully to consumer concerns.
With such fast-changing science and a host of possible unknown effects, it is important to protect Europe' s people and our environment.
Two journalists and human rights activists - Rafael Marques and Aguiar dos Santos - were sentenced by a court in Luanda to imprisonment and fines for simply having criticised, in a press article, the Angolan President, José Eduardo dos Santos.
The integration of the financial perspectives into the Treaty will thereby be a medium-term financial plan which will be agreed between Parliament and the Council.
Sooner or later we will have to be sufficiently progressive in terms of own resources as a basis for this fair tax system.
This is the real challenge.
We have a framework agreed between nations and not one imposed on the nations.
It seems to me that at present it is in the interest of all the members of the Union that any closer cooperation within the Union should be established on a basis of respect for the Union' s legal system and institutions.
These sacrifices, however, are small, given the historic opportunity of unifying the East and the West in a secure Europe characterised by peace.
We firmly believe that it must be possible for Parliament to issue a strong warning to a Commissioner who loses the confidence of Parliament.
With 6 Members it is materially impossible to follow up all the dossiers that are crucial to our country.
I give my full backing to any action undertaken by the Commission on this score.
Action is already being taken, like the food aid which the European Union is providing, as mentioned just now by Commissioner Patten.
This may be achieved by sending technicians and experts who can set up projects in this area.
The next item is the report (A5-0069/2000) by Mr Lagendijk, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the stabilisation and association process for countries of South-Eastern Europe (COM(1999) 235 - C5-0124/1999/2126(COS))
I would like to make a general comment regarding the Conference.
It was good to see all-round commitment most definitely present at all the desks at the Conference.
Without exaggeration, at the beginning of the 21st century we would have a new thirty-year war, 10 years of which, in any case, we have unfortunately lived through.
Am I right in thinking that Russia already subscribes to the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe?
The European Union must conclude that it should respect the frontiers in the Balkans, and that is something quite different from its attitude towards Milosevic.
In February of this year three Kurdish mayors (of the towns of Diyarbakir, Siirt and Bingöl) were arrested on their return to Turkey after they had signed the Aalborg Charter in Hanover in Germany together with 4 colleagues making their towns members of the 'European Sustainable Cities and Towns Campaign' ; they are still being held in prison.
He asked whether the Council intends to raise this issue during the pre-accession process and to ask the Turkish Government to respect the rights of the Assyrian-Chaldean minority in Turkey and, in particular, to ensure the operation without hindrance of their monasteries. He specifically referred to two monasteries.
In response to an urgent appeal from the UN Secretary-General' s Special Representative, Doctor Bernard Kouchner, and from the High Representative, Mr Solana, the Member States have significantly increased their contributions to the UN' s international police forces with both financial and technical support and human resources.
We cannot ignore the fact that this joint effort also needs the Serbian authorities to be involved in the consultative structures.
There is no point beating about the bush on this. This situation is unfair.
I would point out, however, that the practical result is that today, with a few exceptions and despite everything, this situation is under control in terms of security.
The Council presidency has no knowledge of this issue.
The political task is not, of course, to set up IT companies but to build an infrastructure which stimulates development in this area.
This was one of the objective concerns raised during discussions of this issue in Lisbon. It was decided to try and achieve greater coherence between the current instruments for the simple reason that we believe that, rather than creating new instruments, we should reorganise the current ones.
Has the matter been considered from the point of view of the extent to which, for example, desertification in North Africa or the problems of the Mediterranean affect the EU?
The application of these three decisions is clearly the Commission' s responsibility, supported by the committees for the relevant programmes.
In parallel with the work on these practical aspects, a discussion is ongoing within the European Union on determining the mechanisms for participation both by EU Member States which are not members of NATO and by NATO countries which are not EU Member States. This discussion is occurring within the overall context of action on the Petersberg tasks specified in the Treaty of Amsterdam.
The question which has arisen and which has also been raised by the Member - for which I thank you as it is my responsibility to chair the preparatory group of the Intergovernmental Conference - concerns the extent to which this issue may or may not fall within the scope of the IGC.
The Portuguese Presidency will present a report to the Feira European Council in June giving an assessment of the state of progress and an opinion on whether or not these issues should be included within the IGC.
These are the concerns which are raised in my report. These concerns reflect a constructive attitude towards cooperation with the Commission, which I have always considered to be a loyal ally of this Parliament, in the development of an issue which is so very complex.
I therefore feel that funds which cover biometric risks should receive privileged treatment, and that any inflexibility of the system could, in effect, result in negative imbalances for the beneficiaries.
This is the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
With regard to prudential regulation, this should not be disproportionate, so that the security of the fund is guaranteed.
Instead, we should be open-minded and look at the issue from a wider perspective and encourage a framework which is based on liberal markets and vigorous competition between different types of pension schemes.
The free movement of capital must be accompanied by an efficient regulatory and prudential framework, because supervision of the various markets is divided up according to country and sector, but at the same time, as a result of mergers, acquisitions and amalgamations, boundaries between banks, insurance companies, investment funds and pension funds are disappearing.
I also consider that the Member States themselves should be able to determine what the system should look like, for example whether or not the care of relatives should be covered by pensions.
The hope is that the market-based pensions will then also prove to be good for pensioners in thirty or forty years' time.
Finally, I would like to underline our support for the creation of a European pension fund with the participation of the different economic sectors and the pension providers.
Mrs Laguiller, the people trusted the states and the governments, especially the pledges made by left-wing governments, but they have been left with peanuts.
Also, for example, countries where nearly all pensions are capital cover systems, such as Great Britain, do not meet expectations because, although the risks for the government are reasonably small, the cover for the retired is extremely modest.
At this juncture, Mr President, I would like to bring up a remark made by Mrs Randzio-Plath.
This report deals with the issue which is close to Mrs Randzio-Plath' s heart and once again, I would strongly recommend all members attending this meeting to read it.
Mr President, most speakers have expressed their thoughts on the issue of pensions and I would like to say the following on this matter.
Mrs Peijs has asked me when we are getting mobile pensions for mobile people?
I did not fail to notice that Parliament is backing the lines of policy proposed by the Commission.
In order to build a genuine internal market, we should, more than anything, concentrate on promoting the interests of small and medium-sized businesses.
A knowledge of languages is important, for European languages are of great significance to European culture and civilisation, and people need good language skills in order to be able to find employment in EU countries other than their own.
On behalf of the Group, I can recommend supporting this programme.
This is a terrible observation to have to make.
At the same time it is also the right of each citizen in each Member State.
I would also ask, in this era when emotions often take precedence over good sense, that we do not support projects which are aimed at exclusion and the use of language to support positions which often seek to cause divisions between people, when the objective of this programme is to unite people.
In her task she has enjoyed the very strong support of the members of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport.
A second question to the Commission concerns the amendments by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs regarding VAT as a basis for calculating the third source of own resources.
Mr President, the Commission' s initiative on presenting this regulation intended to unify the principles for recording taxes and social contributions is very appropriate.
However, I firstly wish to thank especially the rapporteur, Mr Knörr Borràs, for his work, which, on this complex and technical issue, has offered us great support.
On the other hand, this is the system which best defends the principle of multifunctionality of agriculture, protects the European Union producers, also protects the developing countries, with whom we have a very special relationship, is sensitive to the protection of fundamental social regulations and the protection of the environment and, lastly, it is the system which best obeys the principle of consumer protection.
For all these reasons, my committee voted in favour of Mr Dary' s draft report.
It is our duty to preserve everything the Union stands for, especially on the eve of its enlargement.
Following a transitional period, a tariff of EUR 275 per tonne is to be introduced for bananas from third countries, from which bananas from ACP countries would be exempt.
Commissioner, I too remember the European Union introducing a regulation in 1993 on the organisation of the market in bananas, so as to ensure protection of outlets and income for Community producers and to guarantee the exports of the ACP countries to the Community market.
The Lisbon European Council instructed the Commission to present as quickly as possible practical measures aimed at implementing the Commission' s report on the application of Article 299(2) in relation to the outermost regions.
Having said that, it is not that I do not think it is possible, as put forward in the Commission proposal, to adopt, as of 2006, a system which does not impose quota restrictions or tariffs on ACP countries or any other countries.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank you, Mr Dary, for your wide-ranging and appreciative comments on the Commission' s proposal to amend the common organisation of the market in bananas.
The Commission considers that extending the period in this way would reduce the credibility of the central theme of our proposal, which is that the COM in bananas should be brought into line with the WTO rules as soon as possible.
As I have already said, the principle aim of the Commission' s proposal is to bring the COM into line with the WTO' s final ruling.
Report (A5-0097/2000) by Mr Kuhne, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on giving discharge in respect of implementation of the general budget for the financial year 1998 - Section I - European Parliament/Ombudsman Annex (SEC(1999)0414 - C5-0008/1999 - 1999/2051(DEC))
Mr Brok, could you respond to Mr Corbett' s remarks, and say whether you agree to change the compromise amendment?
That is the old text.
Voting against the report would merely have the effect of sending the report back to the Budgetary Control Committee without a clear expression of what happens next and by what means.
Thirdly, the totalitarian drift of so-called European democracy, with the introduction of mechanisms, in particular making the application of Article 7 of the EU Treaty more flexible so that a Member State can be suspended, mechanisms, then, which will give a handful of leaders authority to operate a thought police across the continent, even against peoples expressing themselves democratically, as in Austria.
I voted against this report and I was not alone in doing so.
When it comes to the voting rules in the Council, we consider that a balance must be maintained between the interests of the small and large states. This can be achieved by laying down requirements for a certain number of votes in the Council which must, at the same time, represent a simple majority of the total population of the Union.
In the Dimitrakopoulos-Leinen report which we have just approved and which I have voted in favour of, Parliament indicates that we have to make further progress and that, to this end, we have to give the European Union the necessary means to complete the shared project of peace and well-being initiated 50 years ago.
The aim of the present Intergovernmental Conference is to prepare the EU for this enlargement.
We now know its general scope, and it is clear that much of the content of this resolution, regardless of its merit or lack of it, has nothing to do with it.
- (EL) The citizens of Europe, especially workers, farmers, small and medium-sized enterprises, women, the young, the nouveaux pauvres, all those who suffer under the policies of the EU, are already voicing their anger and disagreement, some more forcefully than others, with the choices being made by the European Union.
We will therefore be voting against the report.
- The complexity of the IGC process inevitably requires a complex response from the European Parliament.
This is about the Commission' s legitimacy and future and about its being able to claim popular support.
So as not to make the distance between electors and elected representatives still greater, the Member States should remain as constituencies.
It is not just here in Europe that people are concerned, but right across the world.
No Member of this House can remain unmoved by the harrowing situation in which so many Iraqi people find themselves.
Any such action would be grist to the propaganda mill of the Iraqi regime.
That is the purpose of this joint resolution and all the groups have agreed that, to show Parliament' s unanimity on this distressing issue, there should definitely be no amendments.
Mr Salafranca, you and those who are of the same opinion as yourself could also make the Conference of Presidents aware of your views.
What is a proportionate use of force in a case such as Chechnya?
Perhaps stopping the massacre of women and children?
But we should not fool ourselves into imagining that in this case we simultaneously want to achieve something important for peace in Europe and throughout the world as whole, that is to say a dialogue with Russia and ultimately a partnership with Russia.
Last Monday' s General Affairs Council stressed the importance of maintaining an open and frank dialogue, including on this subject, with the Russian authorities.
These people have been in prison for months under conditions we know virtually nothing about.
So it is imperative that we react.
We must make ourselves perfectly clear.
We hope the Council and the Commission will rally unequivocally to our position.
The youngest is sixteen years old and the oldest forty eight.
If Iran claims to respect human rights, trials like this should never be allowed to happen.
It can choose the past, it can choose oppression and barbarity, or it can choose the future, freedom and humanitarianism.
Turkish public opinion need have no fear of our being tempted to encourage any separatist claims whatsoever.
We are not trying to tell anyone what to do, but we must constantly reaffirm that the European Union - as Mrs Malmström said - is not just about creating wealth at home. There are many of us in this House who believe we must go on building Europe to promote and uphold its fundamental values, in the spirit of the founding fathers.
Mr President, two weeks ago, we met Akin Birdal in Ankara at the offices of the EU delegation.
His imprisonment is the product of an illiberal legal system, the abolition of which Turkish democrats are fighting for, a legal system which has made hundreds and hundreds of citizens suffer.
I sincerely hope that she will follow the example of the United States and, at last, wake up to the human rights situation in China.
The European Union must use its inherent authority to work for human dignity and minority rights.
Mr President, as I am sure you are aware, at the moment there is much talk of the reform of the urgent debates, and there are certain influential members of the larger groups who see these debates as unnecessary and consider our resolutions to be somewhat superfluous.
Zimbabwe is a country which, since independence in 1980, has steadily chosen the path of peaceful development under the leadership of President Mugabe.
Let us express our complete confidence in the Zimbabwean people and wish them successful elections for 1 June.
Some people even fear that he is inciting the chaos in order to be able to proclaim a state of emergency and postpone the elections.
A quarter of the names on the electoral lists are fictitious or duplicates.
We cannot hide the seriousness of what has been going on in Zimbabwe for many weeks now.
They work very conscientiously and we should be just as conscientious when it comes to voting!
Would you ask the President to invite the Committee on Constitutional Affairs to consider a change to the Rules so we can check it electronically?
I can understand why you would have to take a head count.
Mr President, I wish to request a suspension of the sitting in accordance with Rule 69(2) and I wish to ask the Commission if their attitude towards the amendments has changed following this vote.
Both your interventions - this one and the one you made earlier - have been recorded.
We will have to evaluate whether it would be appropriate to amend the Rules of Procedure.
In my opinion, it would be appropriate to establish that "young" means those who are young at heart, and therefore give those who are no longer young in years but who are young at heart the opportunity to take advantage of these services.
The European 'Youth' initiative is a first step in that direction, and bears witness to a growing awareness of young people in the EU institutions.
At the practical level, it needs to be made clear that the European Year of Languages is in fact a joint European Union/Council of Europe project.
In the frame of this European Year, most of the amendments aim to establish closer cooperation with the Member States at all levels of policy, not only at national level but also at regional and even local policy level.
But I do not think we should only devote one year to this aim. Lasting commitment is needed.
I am convinced that other operations of a similar nature should be massively encouraged and financially supported by the European Union.
- The British Labour members have a strong commitment to the producers in the Caribbean and wish to see an early settlement of the dispute within the WTO.
As the entire current situation illustrates, that war has further aggravated the situation in the region, both in material terms and in terms of relations between communities.
They hold out the prospect of long-term integration into the European Union on the basis of the Treaty of Amsterdam and in compliance with the Copenhagen criteria.
for the purpose of calculating pensions, certain periods devoted to the upbringing of children or care of family members ought to be taken into account;
Finally, I want to reiterate my long-standing demand - disregarded by the Commission for many years - for revision of the existing directives on equality of treatment of women and men in terms of social security, in the same way as it applies in legal and professional systems.
This being the case, the question here is very much one of logic, allowing us to proceed in the same way as with grain, sugar, rice and eggs.
Surely you can see that.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m.
Anyone who thinks that the school milk regulation will rescue the dietary pattern is wrong.
Mr President, Commissioner, the Commission proposal to henceforth fund the school milk programme by means of 50% cofinancing has evoked a furious response in the Council and in Parliament.
If we do not do that, then the Commission will undoubtedly try in other ways to remain below the agricultural ceiling. What do you think about a reduction on the direct income supplements?
Fourthly, despite everything, we still have a very fundamental question, a question that we have repeatedly raised in vain and I must therefore repeat it again here; why has the Commission nevertheless opted to apply the new policy immediately also to those sectors where the competition policy, as it was hitherto organised, operated perfectly well?
Amendment No 2 deals with the possibility of freeing the distributor by means of the return of contributions once the contract has finished.
Mr President, as we are short of time I will make my statement telegram style.
It will be included in the Minutes.
Mr Bourlanges said that we carry on voting if there are fewer than 32 Members in the Chamber. This is not the case.
(More than 32 Members rose in support of this request) (The President established that there was no quorum)
I actually think that I have not made too bad a job of it.
I am grateful to her for clarifying the purpose of this action and I agree with Mr Jacques Poos' comments.
This situation is getting worse.
It is getting worse right across Europe.
What happened to President Prodi's idea of a rapid rebuttal unit?
I can watch the US Senate on television gavel-to-gavel. But not the European Parliament.
This is the Commission' s line on information policy insofar as it concerns public accessibility.
Public accessibility is just as important as information.
What has been done to regulate aircraft to date?
With regard to speeding up the withdrawal of the noisiest aircraft, the Commission is committed to the work currently in progress within the International Civil Aviation Organisation on drafting a new standard on noise and rules for the withdrawal of the noisiest aircraft.
Mr President, so what needs to happen?
Other airports do not have this but could possibly do with one.
For example, as has already been said, we need to establish what is intended by the word "night" . Does night start at 10 p.m. or at midnight?
However, I have surmised, Commissioner, from the Commission' s report that some basic conditions for this have still not been met.
However, one thing is still lacking from the discussion, namely that we will need the political courage to talk about restrictions, bans if necessary, for night flights during a certain period and reach common agreements on this.
I also hope that the European Commission will not budge one inch from the position it has adopted with regard to hushkits and will not succumb to American pressure.

I am giving the floor to Mr Blokland.
We have now had a speaker in favour and a speaker against.
These are not virtual instruments. We have rules, such as Article 30 of Regulation 1257/1999.
In return the Community must provide support for these products, especially at times of crisis.
Commissioner, you have been extremely active this morning.
I notice that, today, we are concluding this sitting with approximately fewer than 40 Members here to make decisions.
Commissioner, with regard to the forestry issue, I would like to say that, although your openness has sometimes made your words difficult to accept, you have, at least, been frank, in contrast with those declarations made at the time of the incidents, which may have been rather rash.
(The President cut the speaker off)
I feel truly ashamed.
I would like to add in all modesty that at least in the Netherlands, his work has always been - and still is - greatly appreciated.
It was reported in the news this morning that the euro has already fallen below the psychological limit of 90 cents, which augurs even more worrying and serious falls in value.
Mr Gollnisch, pursuant to which rule do you wish to make a point of order?
Madam President, you have given the floor three times to Mr Barón Crespo, although these interventions were not tabled on the agenda.
The Commission thanked Mr Carlo Trojan sincerely for his activities.
In relation to the re-programming of external action appropriations to which I referred, let me summarise the situation as follows: the Commission proposals always took account of the geopolitical importance of each region.
This clearly highlights the drawback of the system, as well as the fact that many countries which presently make use of the subsidies really have no requirement for additional resources.
The Brenner Pass covers a region that includes three countries and, as such, it is a very environmentally sensitive area to which we need to devote particular attention.
At the same time, we shall also have to give consideration to the link between regional policy and transport.
But two of these aims really are vital to the European Union.
In the longer term, it could be that, quite unintentionally, businesses become more vulnerable owing to technical defects in a costly transport system and that jobs could, at short notice, be moved to areas with lower wages, poorer working conditions and fewer environmental requirements.
Nothing therefore to get too excited about for the time being.
It would be useful if the Commission, in its future annual reports, specified what funding has been provided by national, regional and local public bodies and by the private sector, in addition to European funding, with a view to setting up the trans-European transport networks.
Mr President, growth and employment in Europe depend to a large degree upon exploiting European infrastructure effectively.
Also, how tenable and sustainable is the growth we have witnessed within this sector over the past decade?
Is that in any way related to aviation?
This was agreed upon in conjunction with the large political groups.
At the same time, we must ensure that the airline companies really do achieve economic stability, which means we have to try to ensure, through appropriate competition on the ground, that the immense costs of, for instance, landing and ground handling charges are reduced to the kind of level that is usual in other countries of the world.
And this is not likely to change in the foreseeable future
One reason is that it operates according to the unanimity principle and the principle of the lowest common denominator.
This proposal, aside from abrogating the sovereign right of each country over its own air space, will give rise to confusion and will have particularly negative and dangerous repercussions on air safety as, objectively speaking, the competition which is being vaunted here as the trump card will be competition for maximum profit and not for maximum air safety.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have seen that the aim of Mr Sterckx' s report was to guarantee security, safety, consumer protection, fair competition and environmental protection.
I would like to end by referring to some of the questions that have been raised.
Lastly, I would like to make it clear that our primary concern, despite the fact that I have left it to the end, is safety.
Appointment of senior Commission officials
To provide comprehensive detail, that paper also sets out the total number of senior officials from each nationality in the Commission and of the total numbers of all A grade staff of each nationality in the Commission.
In our opinion, we really need new standards.
What you cannot do is judge the individuals who are not yet bound by these standards.
If you ask me, you would be shooting the Commission in the foot and, in my opinion, you would be shooting yourself in the foot more so than the Commission and this is not helpful.
What I do like, Commissioner, is that you, in your information, provide evidence of a transparent policy.
The PPE Group' s question for an oral answer was to be one of the major debates of a part-session - and a passionate plea was made for the debate to be held in April - but, today, the PPE Group is I know not where, for it is certainly conspicuous by its absence from this Chamber.
Mr Prodi has made some announcements today as the head of the organisation.
The common position, therefore, maintains the balance between the various general objectives and the various interests, and we have not therefore tabled any amendments.
I have some sympathy with Commissioner Bolkestein here today.
We only need to think back to the issues we have worked on in the past: risk capital, highly skilled services, innovation tools and the protection of intellectual and industrial property.
She has taken into account the importance of, and urgent need for, this directive, and she has cleared the way for the prompt and final approval thereof.
This Commission will still be within its mandate, at least if Parliament so wishes, because, as you are aware, the Commission as a whole is, of course, reliant on assent from this Parliament.
The Portuguese Presidency will make every effort to reach a common position during that Internal Market Council.
Mr President, I am, of course, in favour of food aid for starving people, despite the commercial operations that are hidden behind this aid and despite the conflicts of interest which divide rich countries on this issue.
For example, the European Union is one of the world's largest producers of starchy products, which are essential for nutrition.
The extension of the regulation will enable a further EUR 40 million to be spent until the end of this year.
By extending this regulation today for a further period of one year, we are also giving the Commission time to prepare a new regulation which I hope will be a multiannual one to replace the existing regulation.
For example in Afghanistan, which has today broken all world records for refugees with six million people having left the country since 1992, leaving the single largest and longest staying refugee population in the world.
It is indefensible and damaging to the programme that no effort is being made to introduce coherence.
The opinion of the Committee on Industry is wholly favourable and I recommend that the House votes unanimously for the motions during tomorrow' s sitting.
Here we must note, with regard to air transport, that Switzerland is, of course, already a member of numerous international conferences and organisations and has therefore incorporated in its legislation quite a few aspects of what we in the EU regard as the acquis communautaire.
Since these instances of enlargement, a debate has begun on differentiated integration.
Bilateral agreements began to be drawn up for Switzerland.
Parliament has repeatedly called for better cooperation and the problem will be further investigated I know by a special delegation of the Budget Control Committee.
The Commission has repeatedly stated that we see a rapid solution to this problem as the prerequisite for any further agreements in other areas.
So I very much hope that the vote which the Parliament holds tomorrow does not surprise any of you and does not surprise the Commission either.
Development in Moldova depends essentially on whether the country can achieve political, social and economic stability.
Finally, it has been established that this phenomenon is often closely linked to organised crime.
To conclude this brief overview of my report, I shall say that the effective protection and implementation of intellectual property rights must be an absolute priority in negotiations with countries seeking accession to the European Union and in all relations with third countries.
We can therefore welcome this appeal for increased awareness and for a uniform mobilisation of resources across the board in order to limit and eventually curb this scourge.
The Union for a Europe of Nations Group, for example, has tabled amendments which may affect the internal market.
Clearly, in any pan-national single market, measures cannot be confined to a single Member State' s jurisdiction but it does not automatically follow that the correct answer is European-wide harmonisation of penalties, criminal law and procedures.
If the proposal for a regulation were to be adopted without amendment, it would mean that there would be a syphon for transferring second pillar funds to the first pillar in Category 4, without consulting Parliament.
This precious asset of freedom is caricatured by those who, deliberately or otherwise, promote the destruction of protective ethical standards. Indeed, freedom only really exists, in any society, when each person has the legal capacity to accept or reject, in full knowledge of the facts, what is being offered to him and not just to engage in litigation after the fact, which gives rise to many problems, as we have clearly seen in the course of these debates.
The European Union is no exception.
So pensioners are responsible for everything that goes wrong!
I particularly welcome the recommendation in this report that national government delegations should be seconded to the European Union structures which deal with incentives for technical research.
Damage to the economy is much more significant.
The fact that such activities are often associated with organised crime makes it imperative for us to define most precisely the legal instruments we wish to create in order to combat it.
- On 7 May last year, terrorism of the most undiscriminating and brutal kind once again struck in Spain with the murder of José Luis López de Lacalle, a journalist and co-founder of the Forum d' Ermua, a peace movement of Basque intellectuals.
At the moment, we only have four.
Mrs Banotti will reply immediately.
We were not getting interpretation throughout.
So, dear Freddy, I did not understand a word you said - but I am sure it was wonderful!
In my view, this is an abuse of a rule which, in itself, is perfectly reasonable because, after all, a majority of this House made a decision on Friday sittings last year.
But let those who want to work here on a Friday do so in peace and quiet.
The third possibility is to hold debates on Fridays without voting and then delay the votes until Brussels or subsequent sittings.
I was unable to receive interpretation, and I am sure that certain other Members were having difficulty with interpretation earlier.
There are Members in the Chamber who attend from Monday to Friday, and remain until the end of the sitting on Friday.
This is because we already spend a great deal of our time in Brussels and Strasbourg as it is, and because we need the time to talk to our electorate.
At present, there is a great deal of suffering in silence.
A blatant example is that of oil, which also concerns my country, and in particular my native island of Lesbos.
However, in the price package, the Commission has not presented anything in this regard to remedy the situation, and the Commission does not appear to be in any hurry to put forward a proposal either.
I am pleased that Parliament agrees with the main thrust of the Commission's proposals, namely that we need more continuity and that prices therefore need to be fixed on a multiannual basis.
It would run counter to the peace clause which states that no new products may be incorporated into the support system.
But what is now happening with the Commission' s proposal is tantamount to throwing out the baby with the bathwater.
This is because we consider that this proposal, since the amendments improving it, which were presented by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, have not been accepted, may lead to the total disappearance of hemp and flax crops in small- and medium-sized holdings, and as an alternative crop in certain areas of the Union.
Furthermore, the dryness of the ground in summer makes it practically impossible to pull up the plant together with its roots in order to obtain long fibre.
Consequently, these quantities are going to hinder development in the European Union with regard to short- and long-fibre flax and hemp.
Most of the flax and hemp grown in the UK is on land ineligible for arable area payments.
I now turn to the first proposal on including flax and hemp grown for fibre in the arable crops regulation.
The second important subject is the national guaranteed quantities.
It is about improved protection for accident victims in the European Union.
Sometimes the process dragged on for ages. When I look at the petitions which have been sent to the European Parliament' s Committee on Petitions because claims arising from traffic accidents in another country have taken years and years to settle, I am quite sure that this directive constitutes a very decisive step forward.
When we debated this, some questions were still open.
I did, and I would just mention this point, rather regret the fact that the compensation bodies - and these were, after all, the Commission' s idea - were gradually watered down during the political consultation process.
In fact, in the first six months of 1999, our Parliament considered the first text proposed by the Commission, adopting six amendments and forwarding them to the Council for their consideration.
In other words, we intended to accept everything that seemed reasonable and limit our amendments to things which were absolutely essential, and even then in a spirit of great moderation.
The Council, with a view to budgetary restriction, decreased that allocation in its proposal and set it at EUR 112.5 million per year.
Decisions need to be made. We cannot risk delay.
We therefore lend our support to the cooperation agreement, on the basis of the EUR 885.5 million, as proposed by our excellent rapporteur.
In the last session in Strasbourg we had another regulation that had also run out last December and this should not happen.
We also support the second amendment.
A democratic and reconciled South Africa is the prerequisite for this "something new and great" , in which Africa and the countries of Europe meet on a new and equal footing and look forward, instead of remaining stuck in the old colonial period.
Following a few incredibly intricate episodes, successive adjournments and time-wasting manoeuvres by the South African negotiators in accepting a regulatory text for this agreement, both parties finally agreed that a new draft of the regulations for this agreement on wines, which is due to enter into force by 1 September, is to be laid down by the end of June.
I should like to retain the possibility of increasing this threshold for the South Africa budget line in the future, if need be.
Mr President, we have not discussed it in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, but my personal view is that we should not accept urgency now.
Secondly, we have learned our lessons from the justified complaints of the Court of Auditors and the Committee on Budgetary Control, for which we are all to blame.
The taxpayer expects us to take a prudent approach not only when we draw up the budget, but also when we implement and carry it out.
What we also need to do is have a vigorous implementation of reform to prepare for enlargement.
Here we have an example of outsourcing that is not working.
We will need to decide whether we want to inject more funding into other institutions in preparation for enlargement. We will no doubt return to these points of criticism in September when we will have the precise figures in front of us.
These three challenges faced by the European Parliament should be set in a context of great budgetary rigour and complete transparency in the use of public funds.
Let us not forget that these parties are the cornerstone of European democracy and there must be no doubts as to whether they are being funded in the correct manner.
To good purpose means improving the potential and capabilities of this Parliament.
By saying that I am being consistent: I said the same to Mrs Müller in the Green Group when she did that.
I have a loyalty to the committee, and when the committee takes a decision I feel duty-bound to defend that decision.
In this respect, congratulations once again on your report, especially on the fact that the report on the Budget 2001 looks beyond the Budget 2001.
Take, for example, the priority under the second pillar of agricultural policy; the highest rate of increase in the Commission' s preliminary draft budget is for promoting the development of rural areas and I think that this in fact highlights that the Commission considers that we need to focus on the second pillar of agricultural policy.
The Council stressed the importance of this remit once again in Lisbon.
I should point out that the proposal for Serbia for the year 2001 makes provision for a fixed sum of 40 million.
That cannot work and it does not work.
OLAF is not one of your broadcasts for DIY enthusiasts, along the lines of "How can we build a model railway?"
We support the Commission so as to make this possible.
Fraud is a scourge as far as the EU is concerned.
I have some sympathy with the last speaker: sometimes the Committee on Budgetary Control gets so involved with the important work they are doing, that they are unable to see the wood for the trees.
In the end, OLAF might have the political leverage and power to demand as much money and staff as it wanted.
Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on a very good report. The very fact that my Italian colleague is opposed to it means that it really is a report of very high quality.
Mr Blak, allow me to apologise officially.
Nonetheless, these two points need to be kept apart both in terms of how they are defined and how they are measured, because otherwise they will both be lumped together and this will give the impression of a huge level of fraud which is not justified to that extent.
They always get big coverage.
That is quite right too because any fraud is unacceptable.
However, the Commission does not intend to give up on this and we are continuing to refine this proposal and will ensure that it is on the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference.
In Parliament we have certain rules that are applicable to everyone.
The objective of this directive is to ensure that the injured party has a right of action against the insurer of the person who caused the accident.
My vote is intended to support the rapporteur' s efforts but prevent the proposed reduction in the monthly increments for cereals.
A reduction in the monthly increments would further exacerbate the economic situation of farmers.
Aid should not be reduced for the wrong reasons.
I agree with nearly all the proposed amendments, but there are some and here I would ask how you evaluate them, Mr Byrne.
I want to say something, however, coming from the Member State which first suffered the full rigours of BSE and which has also, as a result of that, been in the vanguard of cleaning up this problem.
So now we are going to adopt regulations to prevent an epidemic that we have known about since 1986, i.e. for fourteen years.
Consumer welfare demands that we use every means possible to prevent and vigorously combat these diseases and their vectors.
If we are to restore consumer confidence, it is essential that we do all we possibly can at all levels.
On the whole, we must firmly hold to the notion that within the internal market, too, human health is the most important thing, and that principles of free competition only take second place.
That is why some of us seek an Amendment No 56 to allow adjustments in this area on the advice of the Scientific Steering Committee rather than requiring fresh legislation to implement them.
The issue of slaughtering herds has been discussed at length.
For some time Parliament, the Commission and Member States have sought the introduction of common EU-wide rules to deal with the problems of TSEs such as BSE in cattle and scrapie in sheep.
BSE is not an infectious disease that is transmitted horizontally.
Mr President, I will omit replying to that particular remark.
That is an important thing to recognise because in my area farmers feel very secure because of the very low instances we have of BSE and because of the strict controls that we have monitored and made sure worked over recent years.
I also partly accept Amendment No 54 to Annex V, laying down the detailed rules on the extended feed ban.
Furthermore, I cannot accept Amendment No 46 to Annex VIII, extending the ban on placing on the market offspring of TSE cases, for lack of scientific support.
I am adding "provisionally" , because although a number of sectors and activities are already covered by conclusive horizontal legislation, the vertical rules are still pending.
I would call on the Council and both sides of industry finally to resolve this matter.
I would like to talk specifically about junior doctors.
The present situation is not good for patients or doctors alike - they have our life in their hands.
It is not just a question of establishing longest permitted working times but of a good deal else besides.
I am trying to muster support, even if we have not achieved everything we wanted to.
However, to get a 48-hour week, junior doctors must wait nine years minimum and possibly twelve years.
In some cases they were not paid at all, in some cases only half the normal rate.
Well, the proposal does intend to cut hours, but by phasing in the cuts.
Mr President, I must point out how unusually tough the Council is to deal with.
In my view, therefore, we should be satisfied regardless of whether or not this directive meets all our requirements.
The Commission intends, with the cooperation of the French Presidency, to re-table the issue.
They have also had to operate against a background of Member States second, third and fourth guessing every implementation decision that we try to make.
We cannot go on in a situation in which we are not prepared to provide the resources to manage effectively the money that is voted by the budgetary authority for our external assistance programmes.
I have to say, Commissioners, that I find this a deeply worrying and dangerous statement and likely to be taken at its face value by Member States and not in the way that you suggest.
The situation is that we had to do something not just to integrate the project cycle in terms of the line management of activities. We also had to do something concerning squaring the circle organisationally giving substance to my political overall responsibility for development policy.
The other one is the quality-support group which will have its secretariat in DG Development.
The reality, because of the way we are organised in the Commission, is that ownership on our side is extremely vague and problematic.
We understand that the Union' s policy of humanitarian aid does not end with simply granting it, but it has to continue - we talk in this context of a 'continuum' - so that development policies can be carried out.
Firstly, ECHO is not affected by this reform of development assistance.
I know that my colleagues elsewhere in the Commission share this view, which I share with the honourable Member.
NAFO inspectors are obliged to carry out their duties in accordance with rules set out in the NAFO scheme and they are also obliged to remain under the operational control of the authorities of their contracting parties and be responsible to them.
Their inspection was carried out under its auspices.
Since the start of the 1998/99 marketing year, it has not been necessary to pay private storage aid.
That is why we attach particular importance to labour mobility.
I imagined that was the reason for the reference to Murcia, and not the fact that I was born next to that province.
If you think that Commission officials are well employed if I sit them down and tell them to spend a week counting the legal acts issued since 1955, then let me tell you that I do not.
Which chapters have been completed?
If this Charter should become part of the Treaty, it will of course be taken into account in future progress reports and we shall report on how the details of this Charter are being taken into account in the individual countries concerned.
Mrs Thors is raising a point of order.
I should like to ask what your position is on the wishes of Poland and the Czech Republic to introduce long transition periods for two areas of concern to them, namely the free acquisition of land, including farmland, and the freedom of establishment.
The deadlines are laid down in a Council regulation, which for the first time codifies state aid procedures, and since that regulation was only adopted in 1999 it is not likely to be modified in the near future.
I can add that, on the operational level, as indeed I think I said in response to your own question, Mr Turmes, on existing aid to the nuclear industry, the Commission is not undertaking a comprehensive investigation.
It also seemed to us that they had not included a guarantee of the quality of data.
Since the Rio de Janeiro Conference and then Kyoto, the European Union has always led the political side of the debate on climate change.
It is rather pointless for the European Union to try to alarm the whole world with this problem when, in reality, the European greenhouse gas bubble, in particular the carbon dioxide bubble, is more likely to increase by 6% to 8% than to decrease by the 8% that we agreed in Kyoto.
A Union rolling-stock register will be set up, making it possible to identify the rolling stock, its renewal and ageing, in the same way that this is still carried out, albeit imperfectly, for the maritime fleet.
According to the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, these remedies are worse than the disease. These would reportedly lead to further decay of the railway business and deterioration in the quality of services, and would force personnel to strike more, for reasons of self-preservation.
These are two aspects of the overall complex and I therefore hope that the Council really is wise and clever enough to accept the proposed amendments which we shall probably adopt by a large majority tomorrow.
The second figure concerns the average hourly speed of railways in Europe, which is 16 kilometres per hour.
We need to consider the entire railway liberalisation package and combine this with interoperability. In this context, I would like to say that the Helsinki Council resolutions may well be satisfactory, but they are inadequate.
Mr Savary' s excellent report is the first in a whole series of reports which will deal with the rail system and its liberalisation, which is essential, in my view.
Interoperability is rightly not required where regional demands and solutions need to maintain their own legislation within the framework of subsidiarity.
From a position, thirty years ago, when it had a more than twenty per cent share of the goods transport market in the EU, the railways are now down to having a share of less than ten per cent.
It is generally known that the railway sector is of crucial importance in terms of Europe' s future transport needs and a more sustainable European transport system.
Secondly, please be so kind as to point out to your employees that the report is not from the Committee on Regional Policy, but from the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, because we are devising a transport policy for the whole Community, not just for the regions.
The Commission has as its objective to promote the harmonisation of the regulations in the field of transport of radioactive material, which would increase safety in the field.
The Commissioner says she does not feel it advisable to produce a communication.
But it is an area where action at European-Union level really can make a difference.
So, with the problems of the environmental pollution and the effects on health, as well as the issue of cost and the debate about the cost, what justification is left for nuclear processing?
I suspect that the small number of Members of this House who have kept in touch with the plant, both the management and the workers' representatives there over a good number of years, felt the issue more keenly than most.
She said the report came from a press statement in The Independent.
This applies in this case just as much as to anybody else.
I wish them well.
Furthermore in recent years, we have all seen how consumer concern about the integrity of the food chain can devastate a once seemingly secure market.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Mr President, I would just like to make the House and the Presidency aware, as I believe it will be of interest to them, that yesterday, on the occasion of the Conference of Reconciliation in Vienna, an agreement was reached between the Austrian government representative, Mr Schaumeyer, and the American Deputy Finance Minister, Stuart Eizenstat, on compensation payments for the victims of Nazi forced labour in Austria.
Despite this general reservation, the report by the Committee on Economic Affairs expresses the committee' s satisfaction at the restatement in the Commission recommendation of the quantified target, set in the Presidency conclusions of the European Council at Lisbon, of raising labour force participation from 61% to 70% of the population by 2010 and of increasing the participation of women from 51% to over 60% by 2000.
In order to overcome this fragility, in our view, we need the European economy to function better, since it is still subject to excessive corporate rigidity, in both the public and private sectors, and on the part of both economic and social operators.
Although I recognise the contribution made by Parliament and our rapporteur in gaining acceptance once again for the concept of full employment, I think that the rapporteur himself, whom I congratulate on his efforts, would agree that we need to redefine what we mean by employment and by full employment.
The same is unfortunately true of the European Parliament' s report since, out of the 35 points raised in the resolution, not one relates to the single currency, and it is only briefly referred to in the recitals.
Finally, the basic problem still remains.
Something which I have reservations about is the faith in the importance of top-level structures which stands out in this report; a programme and planning from the top may actually put the brakes on development rather than make it dynamic.
We need a strategy.
Do we really need so much growth or can we combat unemployment by other means?
Mr President, over the past few days, the debate on a European economic government has gained momentum once again in different quarters.
What use is the economic growth that the report boasts about, if it is only going to recommend - addressing employees of course - adopting a reasonable attitude in wage negotiations, going so far as to claim that the pension system must be radically revised with a view to protecting their financial position?
On the subject of this last point, as the Katiforis report stressed, there has been a slight fall in unemployment in Europe, but unemployment is still unacceptably high, particularly as regards the level of unemployment among women and young people.
By 2001, public and private investment should reach 21% of GDP and, in 2004, it should reach 23%, which would bring us very close to that objective of 24%, which was mentioned in the Commission' s White Paper on Growth, Employment and Competitiveness.
On the contrary, I believe that since the Stability Pact has allowed for the rationalisation of public finances, it will bring greater public investment in the future.
We are therefore going to ask for more detail in the plans which are submitted, in the structure of expenditure and also of income, paying particular attention to investments.
However, this current satisfactory situation must not mask a series of shortcomings and must lead to the implementation of the series of recommendations which the rapporteur, Mr Pomés Ruiz, correctly makes in his report.
In my view, there is nothing reprehensible about being able to achieve balanced budgets through development rather than by imposing fasting and prayer on the Member States.
In fact, in a context where there are varying degrees of interdependence between States, there are too many variables at work to be combined to produce more general indicators.
There are some Members of Parliament who will vote against my report tomorrow, or who will abstain.
It plunged to DEM 3.45 against the dollar at the end of February 1985, which is a third below its current rate of DEM 2.16 to the dollar.
The Stability and Growth Pact calls for Member States to reach, in the medium term, a budgetary position close to balance or in surplus.
I suggested reconciling points of view within the groups and then tomorrow, in the House, discussing the timeliness of voting this week.
I will not go back to the previous debate although I had requested the floor in order to speak on the previous matter.
It is better than nothing, but not much!
Are we sufficiently aware that, in 1994, when the Member States came to an agreement on the maximum 48-hour working week, they excluded several million workers, such as transport workers, offshore oil rig workers or junior doctors in training?
When, as the report maintains, we consider that all the Maastricht criteria are fulfilled and that, in addition, this country is called Greece - an enchanting name in itself - we cannot fail to realise that this cannot continue and be moved to remedy the situation.
For my part, I can only congratulate Greece as the twelfth country to adopt the euro.
For me, the reason for this is clear.
It is time to implement the structural changes which are often talked about but which are still not being carried out.
This morning I had the opportunity to discuss the Greek figures which were issued a few days ago by the Greek national statistical service.
Paragraph 2 adds, in summary, that undertakings entrusted with the operation of services of general economic interest shall be subject to the rules contained in this Treaty.
Mr President, I also wish to add my congratulations to Mrs Randzio-Plath for the work on this report, which has been difficult at times.
The UN Secretary-General also fervently appealed, on 3 April last, to the donor countries and international financial institutions to cancel all the official debts of the highly indebted poor countries from their accounts as a millennium gesture.
There is an erroneous, trade-based concept that has also made matters worse. This concept suggests that, under the auspices of the WTO, the market can regulate and resolve everything, whereas the opposite is true: economic globalisation has greatly contributed to accentuating disparities, increasing injustice and holding back development.
Mr President, when one hears of the horrendous debt that has built up in many African states, the first reaction is one of deep sympathy.
That cannot be allowed to continue, but neither can the historic reasons for causing it to happen.
The debt cancellation programmes must be tailored to the specific circumstances of each individual country.
We should not be naïve about this.
Last summer, the conditions were amended, with good reason.
These minor observations, however, do not detract from the fact that concessions made must be met and new initiatives have to be launched.
The countries concerned should not be at war or participate in wars, and an agreed proportion of the budget must really be spent on social schemes for the poorest citizens, and must be invested in education, health care and social security.
The Portuguese Presidency of the European Union has furthermore taken care to include this issue in its working programme and has ensured that it was a key part of the agenda of the Cairo Euro-African summit.
It is ruled by a dictator who deems his own power and privileges more important than the lack of stability of his country and the suffering of his own people.
I agree with all speakers who said that we need to ensure that those elections are held as fairly as possible, which will not be easy.
That I do know about.
However, we shall continue with our agenda.
The Jordanians are particularly sensitive to the slow pace of progress.
Nevertheless, it is worth noting that within the specific framework of the GATT agreement, that is, of the General Agreement on Trade in Services, it was specified that negotiations on the so-called built-in agenda would have to begin on 1 January 2000.
Question No 13 by (H-0389/00):
When I speak to small- and medium-sized enterprises, they are certainly pleased about the mood music that is coming out of the Council, but frankly they are a little sceptical as to whether the Charter will do anything constructive for them.
For example, funds to help them with training, education, adaptation of premises or the use of new technology.
With regard to the Charter' s real potential, let us wait for it to be published and then we will, of course, be willing to listen to criticism from small- and medium-sized enterprises and in particular from the European organisations that coordinate and represent them.
The first proposal prohibits discrimination in the field of employment based on racial or ethnic origin, religion or beliefs, disability, age or sexual orientation.
For this reason, the Council decided to renew the common position adopted in relation to Burma-Myanmar for a further six months and, at the same time, to ban exports of equipment that may be used for internal repression or intimidation, and to improve the current visa system, by identifying those people who are covered by this system and those who support it. Furthermore, the Council wishes, with the agreement of all Member States, to refuse to grant an entry visa for the Minister for Foreign Affairs, a decision which could be reversed if it is in the interest of the European Union, to freeze assets held abroad by the persons I have just mentioned, who are associated with these acts of repression, and to make greater efforts to explain and promote the objectives of European Union policy on Burma-Myanmar by establishing meaningful political dialogue.
This coordination does not, of course, mean that there is any transfer of power to the specific framework in which these discussions are held.
A5-0122/2000 by Mr Alyssandrakis, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: Next Steps in Radio Spectrum Policy - Results of the Public Consultation on the Green Paper (COM(1999) 538 - C5-0113/2000 - 2000/2073(COS)).
I am sure this has come as a surprise to many.
We would support action by the Commission to improve cross-border services and honest competition.
Parliament notes that due to the variations in its implementations, the current regime has led to legal uncertainty in different Member States.
In the end, there will be the fear that as we reduce regulations, i.e. deregulate, these big operators will make mutual agreements and 'reregulate' , creating new regulations. This cannot be right.
I would therefore hope that the Commission is alert to this question and that we can engage in a creative discussion on the subject.
The operators are not allowed to collect fees from the users, but neither must the public authority collect from the operators.
. (EL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the launch of the first artificial satellite by the Soviet Union in 1957 marked the start of space exploration and the beginning of a new era for mankind.
This structure comprises the Space Advisory Group and other high-level groups.
A large chunk of the practical applications involving space is already controlled by the market, and I feel that this is dangerous.
To sum up, the new approach to space policy must be based on a close partnership between the Member States, the European Union and the European Space Agency.
For example, the cooperation which has developed through the ecosites, in the field of ecotechnologies, according to the criteria of sustainable development, is appropriate to local development and to supporting SMBs and SMIs.
This is all included in the Commission communication and the report by our fellow Member.
Mr President, I wish to thank Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel for her usual very good report.
There is indeed a growing feeling of unease at the lack of coordination in European science and research.
Firstly, I would like to say that this is a laudable and courageous piece of work, because subsidiarity is a straitjacket which is holding Europeans back despite the brilliance of their desires and their minds. Nevertheless, it lacks a parallel project, which is concerned with human resources.
Attention is being paid to violence in the work sphere, and so forth, but not so much within the family.
The information society requires increasing numbers of people with technological training, which women must get involved in, since this is an area for which they are particularly well-equipped.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
I am especially pleased that this has been made possible for me on the 50th anniversary of Robert Schuman' s appeal to France, Germany and other countries to enter into a common economic policy on steel and coal.
These are the laws of the global community.
This change will open up the field of democratic, plural politics and efforts to bring the European value system back into the consciousness of the Serbian people.
We wish you good luck, Mr President, and we thank you once again for coming here today and addressing us.
We do not feel there is cause for concern but we would certainly like the matter to be clarified, and I would like to say that we regard the Spanish compromise managed by Mr Solana as non-negotiable.
I would ask Parliament to express its view, and I do so with all due respect for the Committee on Legal Affairs and the internal Market, which has held a full debate on this issue, because I believe that there are two basic elements here.
Specifically, the Socialist Group' s position was that, in view of the Act of 1976, all this Parliament could do is what Mr Barón just said, that is to say, take note (prendre acte) of the decision of the French Government, with no other condition.
Madam President, you have consulted the Legal Affairs Committee on the basis of a purely formal decision.
We will defend these rights with equal vigour, because they are our common rights.
Mr President, the representatives of our group in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market have familiarised themselves thoroughly with this matter, and I too represent our group in this Committee.
Supported by a majority, our Group concluded that the opinion of the majority of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market was justified.
We have reached an impasse. I fully understand that you want Mr Le Pen to lose his mandate.
This can happen very quickly.
Misfortune, misery and the false promises of pimps are luring these young women into our countries. They are attracted by promises of employment and some even come in the hope of getting married.
This is why, in our opinion, we cannot use the term 'forced prostitution' in this report.
The fact that she managed to put this important topic on the European agenda is a huge achievement.
We do find it important, however, that it should be possible to grant residence permits on humanitarian grounds.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope you will allow me to speak on behalf of the Greens as my colleague has had to accompany the Member who was taken ill.
There are few rapporteurs who have such direct knowledge of this subject for Mrs Sörensen has been concerned for over 20 years with the issues of trafficking in women and prostitution.
I nonetheless believe that the sex industry, which is now moreover beginning to register some of its activities on the stock exchange, must be called into question and, in future, also held to account.
Trafficking in human beings is, after drugs and weapons, the third largest source of income for organised crime.
These measures, which have already been successfully implemented in some States, must be extended to cover the whole of the European Union.
I would, however, like to draw your attention to a matter of paramount importance: is it not the direct and indirect prohibition of prostitution and the restrictive laws on immigration which are responsible for trafficking in women and forced prostitution?
Because of the natural difficulties about the location of the matches under Euro 2000, the PPE-ED Group as a whole has decided not to support this resolution and to withdraw it.
The exact time will be announced later.
Under the present rules there is nothing to stop Members withdrawing their requests for roll-call votes.
It is certainly not clear to the House that we have agreed to vote on urgencies that have failed to be discussed.
For example, I have been told that I will be speaking just after an hour into the debate, so I guess the Buitenweg debate will take probably an hour and a half at least.
Secondly, due to the democratic legitimacy of the European Parliament.
Recently, more than 400 Members once again stated that we want to decide for ourselves where we meet.
Secondly, that each MEP has documents in his language at his disposal.
We have to live with this, and with its financial consequences, which are not so great, and which are certainly justified by avoiding unhealthy centralisation in Brussels, as is unfortunately practised by a good third of the present Members of the European Parliament.
(EL) Despite the objective of increasing productivity, investment and employment levels in the Union, the Commission' s broad guidelines of the economic policies of the Member States and the Community are a set of negative guidelines: continuing budgetary restrictions which go beyond the requirements of the Stability Pact, wage restrictions, tax reforms for the benefit of the better off, further disintegration of the labour market and the crucial importance of competition policy, which brings pressure to bear on the principles of social justice.
Pomés Ruiz report (A5-0108/2000)
Today, even the multilateral organisations such as the World Bank and the IMF are talking of reducing the debt, for the mechanisms stifling the economies no longer make sense, even from a neoliberal perspective.
The Commission communication before us today is part of this process and the assessment presented is balanced to say the least.
A major effort must be made in terms of harmonisation and simplification of rules.
In addition, in order to bypass the rules arising from its intergovernmental nature which subjects it to approval by its Member States, the UN is using the NGOs which it finances in order to implement its programmes everywhere and with much fewer constraints.
For example, the group from Watford in my constituency whom I met just last week, were witness to racist intimidation at a border post, which is sadly too routine even to be reported.
The European Parliament should be aware that the elements I have outlined are intrinsic to the legislation and that Mrs Buitenweg and myself have come to a clear understanding with the Portuguese Presidency that, in return for our cooperation in accelerating parliamentary approval, those elements will form a minimum in the final directive agreed.
We all have our local examples.
This directive will have a direct impact on the lives of many constituents of mine in Yorkshire, people from ethnic minorities and many thousands of people across Europe.
The hesitation mainly relates to what should and should not be included in the one report.
Needless to say, there are a number of points which we do want included, such as, for example, the right to perusal of confidential information, or whether it is, for example, necessary to establish whether a business administration is not secretly committing systematic discrimination.
This very much strengthens the concept of subsidiarity because, where anti-discrimination is concerned, we should start at the basis, the very place where social dialogue is extremely pertinent.
This is not interference in national responsibilities, but an assertion that the non-discriminatory delivery of these services is a European concern.
Fourthly, the inclusion, as has already been mentioned, of incitement or pressure to discriminate - that is very important.
I think that Amendment No 38 is not well drafted.
However, certain shortcomings must be highlighted.
There is no place for discrimination on these grounds in a modern society.
The reversal of the burden of proof proposed by the Commission would mean imposing an intolerable burden on small- and medium-sized enterprises in particular, as they would in future have to keep a record of every job interview, so that in serious cases they would be able to provide proof.
As you know, our basis is Article 13 and it is an article which limits our room for manoeuvre.
I also agree with the proposal to make it clear that the directive will apply to natural and legal persons, but I must point out that your reference to non-formalised groups of persons cannot be incorporated because this concept is not legally recognised.
This body is called the Committee on equal treatment. It is an independent body which works extremely well and efficiently.
Taking these concrete steps against discrimination shows a willingness to tackle the invisible side of racism which is more underhand and which has insidiously penetrated to the heart of our countries.
The previous speaker' s intervention was not translated properly because it was delivered too quickly, so I would ask future speakers to speak more slowly so that the interpreters can keep up.
Mr President, in mediaeval times groups of thugs and hooligans would pick on elderly women and accuse them of witchcraft.
Red Guards would accuse intellectuals of bourgeois thinking.
This legislation is unnecessary at a European level.
It has been a long time coming.
It contradicts what I properly consider to be the case.
I welcome the directive.
It will lead to risk limitation, by which I mean surveillance methods, video recordings and tape transcripts. Everyone will try to protect themselves as well as possible so that if they are taken to court they can provide evidence.
I call on all those with any sense to oppose these measures.
The vote will take place immediately following the urgencies.
We demand that the sources of the conflict should finally be tackled, by which we mean stopping the arms trade, halting the RUF' s diamond trade via Liberia and Burkina Faso, and ending the interference of states that want to secure national objectives in Sierra Leone under the guise of humanitarian action.
Mr President, the fragmented society in Sierra Leone, the child soldiers and the fights between warlords make it extremely difficult to do anything of any consequence.
The statements have both called on the RUF to adhere strictly to their commitments under the Lomé agreement and, in particular, to the disarmament process.
The issue of the place of the Tamils in Sri Lanka is a long-standing problem dating back to at least the year of independence in 1948.
In this conflict, far too many people have died.
Let us have a peace for all Sri Lankans, based on citizens' rights, humanity and in which government resources are directed at building communities, not helping to destroy them.
Assistance in favour of refugees and internally displaced persons will continue naturally to be given through the UNHCR and non-governmental organisations.
Alas, 12, 13 years later, the violence continues.
Article 5 of the Lomé Convention obliges the Union and the Member States to demand democracy and human rights in Equatorial Guinea.
Iran (press code)
We must try to counter this phenomenon of hooliganism to the best of our ability.
In this respect I believe there to have been a recent example in France which is very important.
Mr President, I understand that we are to vote on the last two resolutions, concerning Guatemala and the non-proliferation agreement, without a debate.
We had the debate on this this morning, we made our decision, let us just get on with it.
Unfortunately, this statement, which is solely intended to give the authors a clear conscience, is completely false.
We must go further and legislate.
We must lead the way in this fight.
This report is very good.
By imposing heavy penalties on criminal organisations which indulge in trafficking in people, we clearly denounce this type of practice.
Thirdly: the victims' rights.
Women are being held in concentration camps in conditions of true slavery and are being tortured before being forced into prostitution.
Furthermore, as Mrs Karamanou has just said, this represents a programme singularly lacking in solidarity between the Member States.
So, as a Parliament, we have more reason than ever before to be sceptical about this right of initiative on the part of Member States. This is not only because this right skews the balance between the institutions but also because, up to now, it has never really been convincingly exercised.
This idea is interesting for three reasons.
Madam President, in Item 5 of the Minutes of yesterday' s sitting on the withdrawal of Mr Le Pen' s mandate, there are two half truths in the references to my speech and to that of Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi and two half truths can add up to one untruth.
It is not a question of whether or not it reflected the committee' s opinion: reflecting an opinion is not the same as being an actual opinion.
However, I believe Mrs Buitenweg cannot attend today' s sitting.
As I already said yesterday, I can tell you again that within the Bureau and the Conference of Presidents, we are in fact in the process of enhancing the status of the work undertaken on Fridays.
I myself have requested that the quorum be checked many, many times, and, on most of those occasions, the quorum was not present.
Let us take advantage of the fact that Parliament is presently involved in the work of the Charter of Fundamental Rights to think about the direction we want this to take. Is it about proclaiming a vision of the human being, and the sacredness and intrinsic dignity thereof, or recognising the rights of individuals in isolation and of separate impenetrable communities?
The Spanish fleet is distributed across a very long list including Belize, Honduras, the Netherlands Antilles, Panama and many others.
In spite of these efforts, something like 80% of all the major stocks are still over-exploited and continue to diminish.
I would like to congratulate Mr Varela on his report on vessels flying non-Community flags that are non-contracting parties to NAFO, which was adopted unanimously.
In places where molluscs are most abundant - and I am thinking of the Ferrol and Arosa estuaries - the size of carpetshells does not exceed 36 or 38 millimetres.
I am also especially interested in the Commission' s proposal on the temporary halt on sand eel fishing in Scottish and English waters.
For this reason, while I have no desire whatsoever to eliminate this activity completely, it may be an opportune moment to debate the possibility of achieving a greater balance, taking account of the various fleets' objectives in the use of resources. Eventually, this new balance should be borne in mind when distributing Community funds for structural measures as well as administrative and market policy measures.
I therefore hope the Council will be able, after this debate, to reach a speedy agreement.
It is called "Seascapes".
Mr President, I should just like to say that I hope the Conference of Presidents will take serious note of the numbers - or rather lack of numbers - of Members in the Chamber voting on that very important report.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Now we have this arrest and Mr Putin says he knows nothing about it.
Yesterday Mr Lannoye moved to table the motion by 185 members to set up a temporary committee of inquiry into ECHELON in accordance with Rule 151 of the Rules of Procedure, which was rejected by a majority at the Conference of Presidents' meeting on 13 April, for a resolution by Parliament.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as far as Parliament and the Commission are concerned, this regulation raises three issues: first, how to prevent abuse of the aid scheme for flax and hemp, because there have been very significant irregularities under the regulation in the past; secondly, how to ensure that flax and hemp, both of which are impressive, renewable raw materials with a strong ecological and social impact, can continue to be cultivated in the EU.
Thank you.
Unfortunately, we have no written documents on which we can really vote and pass resolutions, which is why I support the motion to reject urgency for the time being.
Because this also happens with other debates, I should like to ask for measures to be taken so that we receive amendments in time, before reports are debated in plenary.
I do not want to say that the political parties are the only, or even necessarily, the most important channel whereby the public can have a say in matters that currently affect society, but they play a part, and the status of the European parties must be defined without delay.
This would allow us to end this current situation of a lack of legal status, and I take good note of this and I believe we should work in that direction.
But the solution must include treating political democratic forces in Europe equally, including those which define themselves otherwise and which, for example, are critical of the EU, and not excluding them from this problem-solving process.
We must stress that, after Amsterdam, Cologne and Helsinki, a great deal of progress has been made in developing the foreign, security and defence policy and we would like to thank the Council and the Commission for making this progress possible in these areas.
It is the result of our understanding that a disaster such as we have witnessed in the Balkans must never happen again.
Defence is still a matter for national governments when it comes to equipment and similar questions.
This must be merged, including practically, so that such absurdities never occur again.
The Common European Security and Defence Policy requires a close, intense and transparent relationship between the European Union and NATO.
But it also confirms how weak the critical voices have become.
Secondly: we reject a European military block formation.
I think it is a fairly typical figure.
At this initial stage, Mr President, Parliament should be more involved in the development of this policy.
What I have just said with regard to Parliament, Mr President, is equally valid for the Commission.
In today' s globalised world following the end of the cold war, poverty and exclusion stand out as the main enemies of peace and democracy.
Both play a major role and the military component should explicitly be embedded in the wider context of the civil component.
The European Parliament should also gain greater influence on military action through the budget and proper accountability through the Council.
It should in any event not cause this Parliament to be sidelined even further during the development of the European security and defence policy.
Not only are we ignoring the blatant crimes committed and being committed in Yugoslavia, we are also being called upon to support the need to repeat them with more efficient means and procedures.
You could possibly end the UK's involvement, but you cannot stop what the European Union is doing.
A draft of the necessary decision-making mechanisms is in place.
It is also important for budgetary questions and national defence budgets to continue to be decided in national parliaments.
The last Commission drove forward the agenda on restructuring the defence industries: there were two communications.
This is somewhat disingenuous.
There is a psychological explanation for this.
The specific undertaking to create a European strike force no more than 60 000 strong in order to complete the Petersberg tasks calls for solidarity between all the Member States of the European Union.
We brought forward a new regulation for speeding up our delivery of assistance to the Balkans.
We have made proposals for cleaning up the Danube.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
I. on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directives 69/169/EEC and 92/12/EEC as regards temporary quantitative restrictions on beer imports into Finland (COM(2000) 76 - C5-0137/2000 - 2000/0038 (CNS))
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Mr President, I should just like to point out that I believe that the House has passed an illegal resolution in the vote on the calendar because a four-day week in Strasbourg would only be permitted if there were no additional plenary part-session in Brussels or, conversely, I believe that only if the full plenary week has been exhausted is it legal to hold additional plenary part-sessions in Brussels.
Mr President, I voted not to work on Fridays in Strasbourg although I am totally in favour of our meeting here.
I think it is a disgrace, it is a waste of money and as for the ridiculous ...
We call upon the Member States to consider a change of the Treaty, allowing the European Parliament to decide upon its own seat.
In the enthusiasm of youth, I hoped then to convince my 141 fellow members not to introduce a market organisation for raw tobacco which would give us mountains of unmarketable raw tobacco to deal with.
We have just declared ourselves in favour, much to my satisfaction, of warnings that will cover 35% of the front and 45% of the back of the cigarette packet.
This factor alone is sufficient reason for us to grasp this problem with both hands.
It also refers to the need for a fair distribution of work between men and women, including work in the home, and for measures to make it easier to reconcile work with family care commitments.
At no time did the European Union brook any watering down of the Beijing action platform, although it is, of course, a pity here that we did not have a resounding success on every count and that the clear language in Article 13 on non-discrimination and sexual rights is not reproduced in the outcome document from New York.
I also think that greater attention must be paid to women' s rights in connection with the cooperation that is going on with Mediterranean countries, as it is there that glaring violations of human rights, particularly in respect of women, take place.
There is an evident need to continue to step up dialogue and cooperation with autonomous women' s organisations in civil society, politics and the institutions.
Mr Izquierdo Rojo had already replied to Mr Varaut and therefore, Mrs Lulling, you could not use your speech on a point of order to discuss the issue.
On the other hand, it is true that we are following the development of the situation in Tunisia closely and with a sense of involvement, and we appreciate the positive factors such as economic and social progress, which we do not deny, particularly in relation to the region' s situation and the role played by Tunisia in the Arab Maghreb.
If the violations continue, the Treaty will unfortunately need to be suspended.
Human rights issues are frequently discussed, as the speakers have noted, within the political dialogue which the Council is conducting with Tunisia within the Association Council and through the Heads of Mission of the Member States in Tunis who have regular meetings with the relevant Tunisian government officials in this area.
We believe that there is room for several dimensions to be used in the international arena on this type of issue and we do not reject the efficacy of these actions.
Finally, in the Barcelona Declaration, Tunisia, like the other Mediterranean partner countries, signed up to certain principles involving respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.
I just want to make it clear to the honourable Member that my commitment to making this policy a success is total.
It is also known about in Tunisia, both by the authorities and the people.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, most members here in this House - with the exception of the member who has just spoken - are concerned about developments in friendly, neighbouring Tunisia.
The Mediterranean is not in the third division, it has equal status and importance.
B5-0489/00 by Mr Westendorp y Cabeza, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, to the Council, on China' s accession to the WTO;
The multilateral phase of China's accession that takes place in Geneva has still to be finalised.
We therefore thank Commissioner Patten for his assurance that technical assistance, training for China' s specialists and for those responsible for the new chapter in cooperation will be coordinated with the United States.
From all the analyses I have read, which is quite a lot (both Chinese and Western, liberal and socialist), it is apparent that unemployment is coming to China.
Would he like to estimate what percentage of success the Chinese people will get from these same negotiations?
(The President cut the speaker off)
On the one hand they claim to be controlling radioactive pollution to the marine environment, but on the other hand we have proof that there is radioactive pollution, so there is some contradiction there.
We must all bear in mind that we should be trying, in this specific area, not to aggravate the bilateral tensions which may arise here or there, where these clearly do not involve fundamental principles of identity and the basic interests of the country.
Subject: Significance of Euro-11 Will the Council say on what issues Euro-11 has, since coming into existence, taken decisions that have been of political significance to the European Union and its Member States?
Whenever the issues go beyond this scope, the meetings are extended to all the Member States as is laid down.
Any other mystery for which the operation of Euro 11 may be criticised can only stem from a failure to understand this reality and the information which is actually in the public domain. The issues discussed by Euro 11 and transferred subsequently to Ecofin, which is attended by all the other countries which have not adopted the euro, are widely known, even in the press.
That is true in that case but in the case of Euro 11 this is institutionalised in the Treaty and it is this which is specified.
However, with regard to the overall distribution of quotas, the honourable Member must be aware that this is published in the Official Journal, in the minutes of the Council of Ministers' meetings and also in the annexed declarations.
This requires greater coherence in the internal and external policies of the Union which are the responsibility of both the EU and the Member States.
Given such an inconsistent state of affairs as the European Union giving more resources and being more effective, for example, in the control of meshed drift nets, in the control of fishing, than in the field of the rafts used for illegal immigration, I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council if it would not in his judgement be appropriate for us to have a periodic assessment of the situation in the Straits of Gibraltar and a report on the tiny advances made in this area.
Mr President, the decision by the Member States to develop their military capability by 2003 was taken in Helsinki.
I should like to ask the President-in-Office if he is aware that recent public opinion polls in Austria indicate that over 80% of Austrian citizens want to see the sanctions lifted.
I would ask him to give this House this evening an assurance that he will use his undoubted influence to have the matter discussed at the summit in your country next week.
We are therefore not indifferent to a political development which may lead to the presence, in the executive bodies of a Member State government and therefore a friendly government which shares with us and which has decided to share with us a basic set of principles, of a party which clearly conducted an electoral campaign based on other principles.
The Committee on Economic Affairs has decided to apply the simplified procedure in accordance with Rule 158 of the Rules of Procedure to both texts.
Mr President, I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Marset Campos, on the excellent report which he has presented to us.
But all the scientific committees agree that the number of disasters such as this will increase significantly if we industrialised counties continue to pump out the greenhouse gases at the same rate.
One country alone should not have to bear the burden.
The first is the question of how to divide the burden and has already been addressed.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must start by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Schmitt, on his excellent report and on his suggestions for rationalising the Commission' s proposals.
I hope that the Commission will bring this about, starting with the events in Kosovo, so that the States which bore the brunt of providing asylum for Kosovars will be reimbursed by all the other States.
The sense of consensus is to be welcomed.
Because of the work I have been doing in this particular area I am very concerned about the criminal activities of some asylum seekers who are exploiting members of their own communities, through trafficking in women and young people.
We need clear implementation of good, humane laws and we will all benefit from them.
He does not have access to legal aid in Britain because he has to employ a lawyer in the Netherlands to help him.
The added value of Europol in this process must also be investigated carefully.
From another point of view and bearing in mind the ever increasing importance and influence of the media in our society, special attention should be paid to the way in which the media deal with the reality of these people, which is not always respectful of individual rights, above all when we are talking about minors, whether they be victims or delinquents.
This complete attention must also involve the consideration of family relatives as also being victims.
Mr President, unfortunately Mr Murphy cannot be here with us this evening and I therefore have the honour of representing him here today.
I should like to have known whether it plans to formulate proposals on conditions for setting up debt-collecting agencies, which is one of the issues which we discussed for a long time in the course of the preliminary work but which we left out of this directive for a good reason.
Mr President, allow me to begin by congratulating everyone who has been involved in the creation of this directive and especially those who have done the hard work of negotiating during the conciliation procedure, which I know has been hard, although I personally have not followed it - I followed the two readings, but not this third reading.
On Tuesday afternoon, I went to Poland to take part in an international conference.
It really is absolutely unacceptable.
Madam President, I would not want Members of this House to think that I do not have a sense of humour.
European Council of 19/20 June 2000
The Charter of Fundamental Rights Mr Gama mentioned is a political challenge for all of us.
As for the Union, it will assist the reconstruction of South Lebanon as soon as conditions allow.
This debate reflects the political will of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, and also Parliament as a whole, who wish to achieve an ambitious agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference.
It is completely contradictory to have citizenship without rights.
In the economic field, what we need is greater coordination of economic, social and employment policies.
That is an absolutely decisive point for the coming months.
When you were preparing for the Portuguese Presidency, Mr President-in-Office, I presume you were determined to send a strong message to the public.
And you effectively relaunched the idea of full employment, emphasised the importance of lifelong training, and stressed the considerable challenge represented by the information revolution.
Since then, things have largely returned to the normal routine.
In many respects, the Union is facing a parting of the ways, and the Feira Summit has a vital role to play here.
This only needs officials to attend the meetings. We know that the work of the IGC will be drawn to a close by the French Presidency at the end of this year but it would surely be justified for ideas and projects to already exist which had the mark of the current Presidency.
The second point of the triangle is social and economic cohesion.
We are therefore reassured when we hear those who will mainly be responsible for the future French Presidency choosing the social agenda as one of the main priorities of their political action.
Mr President-in-Office, as you engage in this important debate in Feira, let me tell you how concerned we are about the drafting of the Charter.
It is not simply a question of listening to the President of the Convention, but also of listening to the actual problems which are being faced by the Convention at the moment, of asking what the final objective of the Charter is and of knowing how it is going to proceed.
The institutional questions of the Intergovernmental Conference are enormously important, but they do not reach the people.
The enlargement of the EU will be broadly consolidated at the European Council. This meeting will include a fairly positive progress report, a fundamental step forward for the Common European Security and Defence Policy, the application of the Information Technologies Programme for Europe, the adoption of the Action Plan for the Northern Dimension and the approval of the Common Strategy on the Mediterranean following the first two Association Councils with Palestine and Israel.
The work of this Convention has not yet been completed.
It is exactly ten years since she and the National League for Democracy won that election which the dictators proceeded to completely ignore.
Mrs Kinnock, I thank you for your words.
I voted for the motion in the hope that this further step will be taken as well.
Mr President, at second reading I voted against both the reduction in the payment period from 30 to 21 days, and against the proposed interest level of 8%.
Furthermore, if debts are not repaid, creditors will also be able to claim compensation form debtors for recovery costs.
It is time the Government realised this.
Unfortunately, the right wing has introduced a paragraph concerning Austria into this resolution.
Furthermore we are opposed to a 'high-tech' army for the EU, just as we reject NATO.
- (SV) The main features of the text which has been debated today by the European Parliament are also to be found in a proposal which was presented by Mrs Lalumière in May to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and which was voted on in June.
So there are no grounds for putting words into the mouths of the Members of the European Parliament present in New York on mere intent.
We are talking today about the functioning of a political instrument which we have since, with Agenda 2000, replaced with a new and we hope better one.
Mr Turco and others Members have already reiterated these criticisms.
It also leads to the special treatment of the outermost regions which is covered in Article 299(2) of the EC Treaty, which will allow the Union to continue, consolidate and strengthen its action in order to achieve a specific system of measures that will take account of all the limitations suffered in those regions, whose situation is special, without damaging the coherence of Community law and the internal market.
The three sentences at the beginning are not enough, we asked for a specific chapter, so that we could monitor this area of EU policy separately and effectively.
In view of all the difficulties which undeniably exist, I regard this as a key starting point for greater effectiveness and thus more efficient use of the appropriations implemented, and I believe that this is something that people hit by unemployment in the various countries would welcome.
It also encourages pioneering activities.
Now, considering the forthcoming 2000-2006 programming period, even though management has been simplified and the number of objectives and Community initiatives reduced, I cannot contain my concern and I sympathise with many regional council chairmen as they tackle the issue of the failure to use Community funds and the responsibilities of the Italian Government.
I would, however, point out that it is possible to prove the effectiveness of the Structural Funds, since divergences between States have been reduced.
The population only gets information from the subjective viewpoint of Mr Milosevic and his wife Mrs Markovic.
Therefore - and I am addressing this comment to the Commission in particular - we need all our imagination, flexibility and creativity to development instruments which will nevertheless enable us to support the opposition in this situation.
With regard to Kosovo, after one year that region has still not reached the position we would have liked to see.
All in all, a situation is being created in which democracy is becoming a farce and the regime is trying to keep a grip on the situation by means of totalitarian manipulation.
Not only do people frequently forget about the minorities in Vojvodina, but there is already a stream of refugees and expellees flowing into Kosovo from the border region of Serbia which has an Albanian population.
The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on the other hand, does not seem to see any direct link between the continuous presence of Slobodan Milosevic on the political stage of the Balkans and the continuing instability in the region, one year on from the end of NATO' s intervention against Serbia' s ethnic cleansing which affected Kosovo on a massive scale.
The Commission also supports UNMIK' s endeavours in the area of local administration by means of twinning projects and by advertising posts in UNMIK' s civil administration and the pillars of the reconstruction programme as widely as possible in all the Member States.
The debate is closed.
In this context, we in this Parliament must, in my opinion, support full democratic consolidation in the Republic of Paraguay and appeal for the correct operation of the rule of law and justice in that country.
By the way, I totally agree with Mr Lipietz when he says that what is at stake in Paraguay is not just General Oviedo, but human rights as a whole.
We also believe that it would be a positive thing for the Commission to take account of Paraguayan civil society.
I would like to conclude by saying that as far as we are concerned, the key objective of our international work is to defend democracy and the rule of law throughout the world, including Latin America and also therefore in Paraguay.
While we are voting in favour of the resolution in question, I would like to point out two issues relating to its text.
In fact, having denounced the irregularities of the campaign, demanded the postponement of the second round and withdrawn its observers, it does not seem consistent that it should remain silent with no further reaction or sanctions, contenting itself in reality with merely condemning the situation.
In view of the numerous irregularities and technical problems, and the adherence to the date for the second ballot, the European Union decided to recall its observers from Peru.
Mr President, it is a bit odd in such a small gathering to want to return to the decisions which were taken in an undemocratic manner yesterday.
The victims were a group of young people with banners and flags who were demonstrating against globalisation and genetically modified organisms. Water was thrown out of one of the Parliament offices - I do not know whether it was in a bucket or another container - by, it appears, a Member of Parliament, who then protested in the Chamber against the demonstration.
.
If the German people and their government wish to be the European Union country most welcoming to refugees, they are to be congratulated.
How can a humane asylum and refugee policy which meets the needs of refugees be based on a fundamental assumption of this kind?
These are an instrument of a fortress Europe policy which has nothing in common with a humane refugee policy.
It is fair to point out that the most recent report by the Court of Auditors for the year 1998 has not drawn attention to any single major failure of the Commission in this entire area.
The changes to the whole system have made it easier to control.
It is only reasonable that we should seek to establish that this money goes to the farmers and applies to the hectares, as Mr Casaca has suggested.
Today, eight years later, two Member States have not yet implemented the system at all or only in part.
On the basis of the above considerations, I therefore call upon the Commission and the Council to incorporate the position of the Committee on Budgetary Control and, in particular, Amendment No 1 and Amendment No 2.
You all know that under present legislation and also in accordance with the current contractual arrangements, all matters relating to criminal law are the responsibility of the Member States.
In the case of production per hectare which amounts to little more than ESP 100 000, I believe that the operational funds of the COM in fruits have very little significance and offer very little in terms of resolving the problem of nuts.
Since these producers have the political support of this House, I believe that it would not be justifiable to deny them a few pesetas of economic support.
In industry, one can modernise plants and improve productivity, but in the case of certain crops, however much investment is made, however many changes are made in terms of marketing, we cannot alter the fact that certain areas are arid or semi-arid.
We should also remember, Commissioner, that there is practically no alternative to the cultivation of nuts because of the places in which they are produced.
To fly the Union flag upside-down is an internationally recognised distress signal and to fly it upside-down when it is not a distress signal is a gross affront to the flag, the British people and the British nation.
However, yesterday's Minutes refers to the wrong paragraph and thus the vote does not reflect what actually took place in this Chamber.
Thank you for bringing this to our attention.
We are all responsible for achieving this; the Monitoring Centre, our national public institutions and the Member States themselves.
As the issue of hypocrisy is so often raised in relation to the tobacco and drugs debate, would it not be appropriate here to mention other forms of hypocrisy, such as those tax havens in which drugs money takes refuge?
It is a goal or vision, just like every other vision the Union has when it comes to social destitution and other phenomena we wish to combat.
I see that our co-rapporteur is also requesting the floor.
All of the Member States are affected to a greater or lesser degree by the problems of applying Community law.
As for methods, I think they can be improved.
A general campaign is needed here.
So instead of reducing working time in this House we should devote a little more time to underlining the failures of the European Union to implement its decisions.
Let me once again, on behalf of the European Parliament, express our deepest sympathy to the family of Pierre Pflimlin, especially his daughter who is attending our sitting at this very moment.
Madam President, on a point of order, I have here a report which appeared in the British newspaper The Independent concerning a meeting which appears to have taken place between yourself and Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.
I can, however, tell you that the euro was the focus of all my discussions with the authorities I met, and that they all showed great interest in this question.
A motion reflecting the report's conclusions was adopted almost unanimously by Parliament.
Madam President, I would like to make a suggestion and ask the Members whether this resolution on hooliganism will also deal with the incidents which occurred at the Rotterdam stadium. You can put it to the vote if need be.
I feel this is a reasonable suggestion, for if we do not make an effort to act in some way we would certainly be guilty of reluctance to do our duty. I would find this totally unacceptable.
This is all the more important given the known intention of the Scottish Football Association to apply to host the next European Cup but one.
In any event, we think it important that the European Parliament should express its opinion on the subject in the few days before this conference.
(Parliament rejected the request) President.
That is why we should like to add this item.
At Feira, Javier Solana and I presented a follow-up report outlining what had been achieved in the western Balkans since Lisbon.
First of all we were enormously grateful to the delegation from Parliament that went recently to Kosovo and was able to confirm that our team there is doing a good job and that there is not an absorption capacity problem as far as the assistance is concerned.
I am sure we will be doing that in the next few months although it is important for us to concentrate on the real priorities for the IGC before Nice.
As a result of your action, the Austrian question has become a European Union issue.
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to echo our President' s tribute to President Pfimlin, who, as well as being a predecessor of mine and a great friend, was the person who welcomed the Spanish and Portuguese MEPs when we arrived in this House, precisely because we had built a community of values in our countries of the type we are now trying to strengthen.
It even seems that the images of the distant future conjured up by a good many ministers are actually intended to conceal the European Council's inability to resolve the issues it has set itself.
The public's confidence in the EU has now reached an all-time low in all the Member States.
I believe that Parliament too must take considerable responsibility for having undermined this body that is central to European construction, but I think that the Council is continuing to exacerbate the sideways shift and that we must, as a matter of urgency, change course and put the Commission back at the centre of the Community' s construction.
Firstly, there is the new political stance in its relations with Parliament, which my colleague Mr Barón Crespo has already mentioned.
I think that Feira will go down in the history books not so much for what it said but mainly for what it did not say on institutional issues.
We need cooperation between European and Indian companies.
Only in this way will it be possible to boost the strength of the euro.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are some fine phrases in the conclusions from the Feira Summit, as there are about progress at the current Intergovernmental Conference, but there are really no solutions in sight.
We have talked about the information society and the information society action plan has been approved.
With regard to the tax package, it is not by chance that we have been waiting twelve years for an agreement to be concluded.
I can answer very directly: in my own area it is a subject about which I have made one or two speeches recently.
Our aspirations are as simple and as straightforward as that, and they have the great advantage of reflecting what is written in the treaties.
That is why the Community budget needs to be protected by means of directives, regulations and other measures.
Unbridled globalisation calls for ever-increasing political regulation, coordination, harmonisation and supranational bodies, on a scale and to a standard which is commensurate with organised crime.
This money is laundered and put into circulation in the legal economy.
Anyone who prevents this from happening, or at least makes it considerably more difficult, cuts organised crime to the quick, stunts its growth and damages its ability to propagate itself.
Institutions, such as banks, and also individuals with similar responsibilities, such as notaries and lawyers, are to be involved in resolving crimes of money laundering.
It must not come to that!
The resolution also calls for the transfer of data to be authorised only when the system is fully operative and for operation of the system to be adequately monitored.
You say that information can currently be provided by means of a contract.
The majority, not all, but the majority, of these rights involve legal redress, in the last instance, after having been subject to a complaint to the competent governmental body.
Yet we cannot attempt to change the way the Americans deal with their own national legislation and legal system.
It is a voluntary standard which American firms would themselves apply internally and then only with regard to Europeans.
If we adopt this report, we will not only be expressing our political will to succeed in concluding an agreement containing protection clauses which respect European legislation, but we will also be encouraging a large proportion of Congress and of United States' public opinion to develop personal data protection laws.
For example, there was a proposal to introduce so-called reciprocity.
In Europe we have come so far - I only need to mention the implementation of Schengen, meaning that there are no longer any controls at the vast majority of borders - that nothing else is simply good enough anymore.
Amendment No. 2 is important.
In the past, as rapporteur, Mr Lehne has already had the opportunity to show his interest, expertise and commitment in this subject that he has just presented.
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Turkey cannot behave in this way and continue on its path towards Europe and the European Parliament should make that clear.
1998 discharge
the report (A5-0190/2000) by Mrs Stauner, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on giving discharge to the Commission in respect of implementation of the general budget of the European Union for the 1998 financial year (SEC(1999) 412 - C5-0006/1999 - 1999/2050(DEC))
At Lisbon, the European Council committed the Member States to making great efforts to eradicate poverty, and a High Level Group on social protection is working with the Commission on this ambitious strategy.
Does asking for the directives such as those on 'birds' , 'habitats' , 'open air markets' or 'biotechnologies' to be amended make one anti-European?
In order for France to speak with a single voice, it is the voice of the people which must be heard. The 'blues' showed us the way.
We already had an opportunity to note as much yesterday as, according to the tradition, there was a working meeting between the government, all the Commissioners, the Commission President, the Prime Minister and myself. This enabled us to observe the synergy between our concerns and ambitions.
He looked to the IGC to extend the use of codecision.
Everything that can give new impetus to the construction of Europe must be achieved both within the institutions and in accordance with the acquis communautaire.
We shall carry out our work in this field as quickly and as well as possible, with a view, I would stress, as President Prodi said just now, to enlarging as quickly as possible.
(Laughter) Perhaps it was a rather provocative thing to say, but there was also an element of Cantal or Auvergne good sense behind this comment.
The President is forced to leave us because the family of the hostage held on Jolo, Sonia Wendling, asked to meet President Jacques Chirac, in his capacity as President-in-Office of the Council, to see how all these poor hostages might be released as quickly as possible.
With a view to creating a Europe that is closer to the citizens, I shall not go through the French Presidency' s entire programme, I have just two points to make.
These services of general interest contribute to the social and territorial cohesion of the European Union, as enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam.
I shall use my speaking time, however, to remind you that this Parliament asked the IGC to grant Parliament the right finally to decide on its own location.
This would be a missed opportunity for us.
We would like to make it possible for the countries who so desire to cooperate more closely to present a united front in a number of sectors such as economic and monetary union, which is still far from being fully achieved, internal security, and defence and foreign policy, which represents an open, dynamic core of more advanced integration.
More specifically, I should also like to acknowledge the encouragement given to the French Government by Pervenche Berès and Klaus Hänsch, as well as the ambition sought by some speakers, such as Mr Watson. I would also like to reassure Mr Cohn-Bendit with regard to the vision that drives my government and which has perhaps made an effective contribution to certain positions.
I wish to assure the European Parliament that this Charter is one of our priorities and we hope that the Convention will prove worthy of the task so that we will be able to discuss it in detail at the Biarritz European Council, with a view, as the French President has said, to making as much progress as possible with the content.
Indeed, in the view of our 190 election observers with experience of seven observation missions as an average, the pre-election period was one of the worst they had ever been in, while the actual election days, the polling, voting and count were among the best they had been.
Let me use this opportunity to pay tribute to the Election Unit, to the EU observers including friends from Norway and Kenya who were integrated into our mission, as well as five Members of the European Parliament.
Apart from tolerating, and even, as we know, promoting, a climate of intimidation and violence, Mugabe has made considerable errors of judgement.
The Archbishop of Bulawayo has been threatened.
We must take the argument directly to the man who has created the problems.
The Council Presidency fully supports the Commission' s analysis of the need to cooperate with Zimbabwe.
Thank you very much, Minister
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Council of Ministers has been deeply shocked by the events at Dover and the deaths of 58 Chinese nationals in tragic circumstances.
These events demonstrate the increasing pressure that migration is putting on Western Europe, which we have been aware of for some time.
We must therefore combat these smugglers first of all.
The opportunity to adopt the nationality of Member States is also a fundamental aspect of integrating foreign nationals in Europe, but we realise that, in this area, each country applies its own laws.
This is another important tool in the fight against illegal immigration.
I welcome what we have heard about that this afternoon.
First of all, I should like to state the Commission' s position on the Tampere programme.
I am not only talking about the instrument for the regulation of Eurodac. I am also talking about the proposal for a decision on the European Refugee Fund, the directive on temporary protection, the revision of the Dublin Convention, which determines which State is responsible for examining applications for asylum, and the results of the consultation on the definition of the common rules of procedure on asylum issues.
We all feel disappointed and the reality of the situation is indeed disappointing, but I must tell you - and this point needs to be emphasised - that the Commission has tabled the proposals that were laid down within the deadlines that were set.
This is not, however, the only financial instrument with repercussions for environmental policies. We know, for example, that regional and agricultural policy, which is to a large extent harmful, has an enormous impact on the environment and on Europe' s land and water.
I also welcome the fact that the Member States have allocated an increase of EUR 27 million for the new LIFE programme for the next five years and that the overall budgetary allocation made to the LIFE programme will be in the region of EUR 640 million.
The implementation in practice of innovative measures in the area of Structural Funds has not got under way because preparatory work on the part of the Commission has lagged seriously behind.
In two particular areas we are affected by multiannual programmes.
Ladies and Gentlemen, I do not know if the Council is aware of the real situation.
We will examine questions to the Council, which is represented by Mr Moscovici, Minister for European Affairs, who many of you will know since he is a former Member of the European Parliament.
This is to be the lower House, as the President of the Republic told us this morning and if we are to carry public opinion with us in security and defence matters we need a proper position.
(FR) There is indeed a project, or rather studies, in progress with regard to the transportation of water from the Rhone to Catalonia, but - for the time being at least - it does not involve the French or Spanish authorities.
It was adopted recently through a conciliation procedure on 29 June 2000.
A problem has also arisen that various elements of the digital radio spectrum are now being allocated across Europe often quite freely, at no charge at all.
On 2 May 2000, the Council stressed the importance of striking a balance between legal security, chiefly guaranteed by the binding provisions, and the ability to react speedily to technological and market developments, using flexible measures.
In other words, I repeat, the Council continues to approach the issue openly.
I should also like to remind you that the presidency has the mandate to do this on the basis of the positions adopted by the Council.
In order to achieve this, a South-East regional group was set up together with a working group on economic reconstruction that also encompasses trade relations.
However, the embargo against Iraq is still being applied, with dramatically harmful consequences for the Iraqi population. One very typical example is the huge increase in infant mortality, which over the last ten years has been recorded at 1.5 million child deaths due to lack of medicine, food etc.
I wonder whether the French presidency believes there is cause for examining this case on the basis of Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty.
Is the Council considering the possibility of influencing the trade in diamonds from Sierra Leone and the Great Lakes region in a way that might prove conducive to peace in those areas?
Mr President, draft supplementary and amending budget no. 2/2000 contains appropriations for the Council and for Parliament.
EU military staff will be posted there, for example, including military experts who have been transferred from Member States.
Mr President, Commissioner, fellow members, it may only be July, but today, the European Union and the European Parliament come to the Member States bearing gifts in the form of a supplementary budget refunding EUR 3.2 billion to their original owners.
This shows that we are handling funds properly and the rapporteur, my friend Jean-Louis Bourlanges, has just set the facts of the matter out clearly for us.
I should like to thank the rapporteurs and to tell the rapporteur, Mr Bourlanges, that the Commission has accepted all Parliament's proposed amendments, even where, for example in the case of Montenegro, the remaining margin is extremely tight, but that means we must be economical and that is what we intend to be.
There has also been a great deal of upheaval and restructuring and some evidence of the formation of new monopolies, something which must be combated.
However there are environmental implications which we have not taken very seriously.
First of all, the liberalisation process does not proceed at the same pace in all the Member States and secondly, there is also a difference in timing within the respective Member States.
The same amendment also aims to promote the interests of the consumers within the liberalised energy market by guaranteeing universal service provision.
Mr President, monopolies are not acceptable, whether state or otherwise, and we must be careful with the single market not to create new private monopolies in the energy sector.
I am referring to social and environmental concerns which this Parliament has always supported but which are not yet sufficiently articulated in the energy sector with reference to the single market.
If we support network access for renewables in Europe, we should not find ourselves in this position.
I also believe that it is very important for us to distinguish between the processes of market efficiency that liberalization implies and other policy objectives that we may wish to achieve, such as the question of universal supply, such as the aims to reduce CO2 and it is very important to keep those two distinct and separate.
Who will benefit from this and how exactly?
